aircAruvnKk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk,But what is a neural network? | Deep learning chapter 1,"This is a 3. It's sloppily written and rendered at an extremely low resolution of 28x28 pixels, but your brain has no trouble recognizing it as a 3. And I want you to take a moment to appreciate how crazy it is that brains can do this so effortlessly. I mean, this, this and this are also recognizable as 3s, even though the specific values of each pixel is very different from one image to the next. The particular light-sensitive cells in your eye that are firing when you see this 3 are very different from the ones firing when you see this 3. But something in that crazy-smart visual cortex of yours resolves these as representing the same idea, while at the same time recognizing other images as their own distinct ideas. But if I told you, hey, sit down and write for me a program that takes in a grid of 28x28 pixels like this and outputs a single number between 0 and 10, telling you what it thinks the digit is, well the task goes from comically trivial to dauntingly difficult. Unless you've been living under a rock, I think I hardly need to motivate the relevance and importance of machine learning and neural networks to the present and to the future. But what I want to do here is show you what a neural network actually is, assuming no background, and to help visualize what it's doing, not as a buzzword but as a piece of math. My hope is that you come away feeling like the structure itself is motivated, and to feel like you know what it means when you read, or you hear about a neural network quote-unquote learning. This video is just going to be devoted to the structure component of that, and the following one is going to tackle learning. What we're going to do is put together a neural network that can learn to recognize handwritten digits. This is a somewhat classic example for introducing the topic, and I'm happy to stick with the status quo here, because at the end of the two videos I want to point you to a couple good resources where you can learn more, and where you can download the code that does this and play with it on your own computer. There are many many variants of neural networks, and in recent years there's been sort of a boom in research towards these variants, but in these two introductory videos you and I are just going to look at the simplest plain vanilla form with no added frills. This is kind of a necessary prerequisite for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants, and trust me it still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds around. But even in this simplest form it can learn to recognize handwritten digits, which is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do. And at the same time you'll see how it does fall short of a couple hopes that we might have for it. As the name suggests neural networks are inspired by the brain, but let's break that down. What are the neurons, and in what sense are they linked together? Right now when I say neuron all I want you to think about is a thing that holds a number, specifically a number between 0 and 1. It's really not more than that. For example the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to each of the 28x28 pixels of the input image, which is 784 neurons in total. Each one of these holds a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel, ranging from 0 for black pixels up to 1 for white pixels. This number inside the neuron is called its activation, and the image you might have in mind here is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number. So all of these 784 neurons make up the first layer of our network. Now jumping over to the last layer, this has 10 neurons, each representing one of the digits. The activation in these neurons, again some number that's between 0 and 1, represents how much the system thinks that a given image corresponds with a given digit. There's also a couple layers in between called the hidden layers, which for the time being should just be a giant question mark for how on earth this process of recognizing digits is going to be handled. In this network I chose two hidden layers, each one with 16 neurons, and admittedly that's kind of an arbitrary choice. To be honest I chose two layers based on how I want to motivate the structure in just a moment, and 16, well that was just a nice number to fit on the screen. In practice there is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here. The way the network operates, activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer. And of course the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down to exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer. It's meant to be loosely analogous to how in biological networks of neurons, some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire. Now the network I'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits, and let me show you what I mean by that. It means if you feed in an image, lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of each pixel in the image, that pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer which causes some pattern in the one after it, which finally gives some pattern in the output layer. And the brightest neuron of that output layer is the network's choice, so to speak, for what digit this image represents. And before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next, or how training works, let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently. What are we expecting here? What is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing? Well, when you or I recognize digits, we piece together various components. A 9 has a loop up top and a line on the right. An 8 also has a loop up top, but it's paired with another loop down low. A 4 basically breaks down into three specific lines, and things like that. Now in a perfect world, we might hope that each neuron in the second to last layer corresponds with one of these subcomponents, that anytime you feed in an image with, say, a loop up top, like a 9 or an 8, there's some specific neuron whose activation is going to be close to 1. And I don't mean this specific loop of pixels, the hope would be that any generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron. That way, going from the third layer to the last one just requires learning which combination of subcomponents corresponds to which digits. Of course, that just kicks the problem down the road, because how would you recognize these subcomponents, or even learn what the right subcomponents should be? And I still haven't even talked about how one layer influences the next, but run with me on this one for a moment. Recognizing a loop can also break down into subproblems. One reasonable way to do this would be to first recognize the various little edges that make it up. Similarly, a long line, like the kind you might see in the digits 1 or 4 or 7, is really just a long edge, or maybe you think of it as a certain pattern of several smaller edges. So maybe our hope is that each neuron in the second layer of the network corresponds with the various relevant little edges. Maybe when an image like this one comes in, it lights up all of the neurons associated with around 8 to 10 specific little edges, which in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop and a long vertical line, and those light up the neuron associated with a 9. Whether or not this is what our final network actually does is another question, one that I'll come back to once we see how to train the network, but this is a hope that we might have, a sort of goal with the layered structure like this. Moreover, you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks. And even beyond image recognition, there are all sorts of intelligent things you might want to do that break down into layers of abstraction. Parsing speech, for example, involves taking raw audio and picking out distinct sounds, which combine to make certain syllables, which combine to form words, which combine to make up phrases and more abstract thoughts, etc. But getting back to how any of this actually works, picture yourself right now designing how exactly the activations in one layer might determine the activations in the next. The goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges, or edges into patterns, or patterns into digits. And to zoom in on one very specific example, let's say the hope is for one particular neuron in the second layer to pick up on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here. The question at hand is what parameters should the network have? What dials and knobs should you be able to tweak so that it's expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern, or any other pixel pattern, or the pattern that several edges can make a loop, and other such things? Well, what we'll do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our neuron and the neurons from the first layer. These weights are just numbers. Then take all of those activations from the first layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights. I find it helpful to think of these weights as being organized into a little grid of their own, and I'm going to use green pixels to indicate positive weights, and red pixels to indicate negative weights, where the brightness of that pixel is some loose depiction of the weight's value. Now if we made the weights associated with almost all of the pixels zero except for some positive weights in this region that we care about, then taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values really just amounts to adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about. And if you really wanted to pick up on whether there's an edge here, what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels. Then the sum is largest when those middle pixels are bright but the surrounding pixels are darker. When you compute a weighted sum like this, you might come out with any number, but for this network what we want is for activations to be some value between 0 and 1. So a common thing to do is to pump this weighted sum into some function that squishes the real number line into the range between 0 and 1. And a common function that does this is called the sigmoid function, also known as a logistic curve. Basically very negative inputs end up close to 0, positive inputs end up close to 1, and it just steadily increases around the input 0. So the activation of the neuron here is basically a measure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is. But maybe it's not that you want the neuron to light up when the weighted sum is bigger than 0. Maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than say 10. That is, you want some bias for it to be inactive. What we'll do then is just add in some other number like negative 10 to this weighted sum before plugging it through the sigmoid squishification function. That additional number is called the bias. So the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the second layer is picking up on, and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active. And that is just one neuron. Every other neuron in this layer is going to be connected to all 784 pixel neurons from the first layer, and each one of those 784 connections has its own weight associated with it. Also, each one has some bias, some other number that you add on to the weighted sum before squishing it with the sigmoid. And that's a lot to think about! With this hidden layer of 16 neurons, that's a total of 784 times 16 weights, along with 16 biases. And all of that is just the connections from the first layer to the second. The connections between the other layers also have a bunch of weights and biases associated with them. All said and done, this network has almost exactly 13,000 total weights and biases. 13,000 knobs and dials that can be tweaked and turned to make this network behave in different ways. So when we talk about learning, what that's referring to is getting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these many many numbers so that it'll actually solve the problem at hand. One thought experiment that is at once fun and kind of horrifying is to imagine sitting down and setting all of these weights and biases by hand, purposefully tweaking the numbers so that the second layer picks up on edges, the third layer picks up on patterns, etc. I personally find this satisfying rather than just treating the network as a total black box, because when the network doesn't perform the way you anticipate, if you've built up a little bit of a relationship with what those weights and biases actually mean, you have a starting place for experimenting with how to change the structure to improve. Or when the network does work but not for the reasons you might expect, digging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge your assumptions and really expose the full space of possible solutions. By the way, the actual function here is a little cumbersome to write down, don't you think? So let me show you a more notationally compact way that these connections are represented. This is how you'd see it if you choose to read up more about neural networks. Organize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector. Then organize all of the weights as a matrix, where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connections between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer. What that means is that taking the weighted sum of the activations in the first layer according to these weights corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here. By the way, so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra, so for any of you who want a nice visual understanding for matrices and what matrix vector multiplication means, take a look at the series I did on linear algebra, especially chapter 3. Back to our expression, instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values independently, we represent it by organizing all those biases into a vector, and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product. Then as a final step, I'll wrap a sigmoid around the outside here, and what that's supposed to represent is that you're going to apply the sigmoid function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside. So once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols, you can communicate the full transition of activations from one layer to the next in an extremely tight and neat little expression, and this makes the relevant code both a lot simpler and a lot faster, since many libraries optimize the heck out of matrix multiplication. Remember how earlier I said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers? Well of course the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in, so it's actually more accurate to think of each neuron as a function, one that takes in the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between 0 and 1. Really the entire network is just a function, one that takes in 784 numbers as an input and spits out 10 numbers as an output. It's an absurdly complicated function, one that involves 13,000 parameters in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns, and which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid squishification function, but it's just a function nonetheless. And in a way it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated. I mean if it were any simpler, what hope would we have that it could take on the challenge of recognizing digits? And how does it take on that challenge? How does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data? Well that's what I'll show in the next video, and I'll also dig a little more into what this particular network we're seeing is really doing. Now is the point I suppose I should say subscribe to stay notified about when that video or any new videos come out, but realistically most of you don't actually receive notifications from YouTube, do you? Maybe more honestly I should say subscribe so that the neural networks that underlie YouTube's recommendation algorithm are primed to believe that you want to see content from this channel get recommended to you. Anyway, stay posted for more. Thank you very much to everyone supporting these videos on Patreon. I've been a little slow to progress in the probability series this summer, but I'm jumping back into it after this project, so patrons you can look out for updates there. To close things off here I have with me Lisha Li who did her PhD work on the theoretical side of deep learning and who currently works at a venture capital firm called Amplify Partners who kindly provided some of the funding for this video. So Lisha one thing I think we should quickly bring up is this sigmoid function. As I understand it early networks use this to squish the relevant weighted sum into that interval between zero and one, you know kind of motivated by this biological analogy of neurons either being inactive or active. Exactly. But relatively few modern networks actually use sigmoid anymore. Yeah. It's kind of old school right? Yeah or rather ReLU seems to be much easier to train. And ReLU, ReLU stands for rectified linear unit? Yes it's this kind of function where you're just taking a max of zero and a where a is given by what you were explaining in the video and what this was sort of motivated from I think was a partially by a biological analogy with how neurons would either be activated or not. And so if it passes a certain threshold it would be the identity function but if it did not then it would just not be activated so it'd be zero so it's kind of a simplification. Using sigmoids didn't help training or it was very difficult to train at some point and people just tried ReLU and it happened to work very well for these incredibly deep neural networks.

Unzc731iCUY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY,How to Speak,"PATRICK WINSTON: The Uniform Code of Military Justice specifies court martial for any officer who sends a soldier into battle without a weapon. There ought to be a similar protection for students because students shouldn't go out into life without the ability to communicate, and that's because your success in life will be determined largely by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas, in that order. I know that I can be successful in this because the quality of communication, your speaking, your writing, is largely determined by this formula. It's a matter of how much knowledge you have, how much you practice with that knowledge, and your inherent talent, and notice that the T is very small. What really matters is what you know. This point came to me suddenly a few decades ago when I was skiing at Sun Valley. I had heard that it was Celebrity Weekend, and one of the celebrities was Mary Lou Retton, famous Olympic gymnast, perfect 10s in the vault. And I heard that she was a novice at skiing, so when the opportune moment arrived, I looked over on the novice slope and saw this young woman who, when she became unbalanced, went like that. And I said that's got to be her. That must be the gymnast. But then, it occurred to me, I'm a much better skier than she is, and she's an Olympic athlete-- not only an ordinary Olympic athlete, an outstanding one. And I was a better skier because I had the K, and I had the P, and all she had was the T. So you can get a lot better than people who may have inherent talents if you have the right amount of knowledge. So that's what my objective is today, and here's my promise. Today, you will see some examples of what you can put in your armamentarium of speaking techniques, and it will be the case that some one of those examples, some heuristic, some technique, maybe only one, will make-- will be the one that gets you the job. And so this is a very non-linear process. You never know when it's going to happen, but that is my promise. By the end of the next 60 minutes, you'll have been exposed to a lot of ideas, some of which you'll incorporate into your own repertoire, and they will ensure that you get the maximum opportunity to have your ideas valued and accepted by the people you speak with. Now, in order to do that, we have to have a rule of engagement, and that is no laptops, no cell phones. So if you could close those, I'll start up as soon as you're done. Some people ask why that is a rule of engagement, and the answer is, we humans only have one language processor. And if your language processor is enga-- could you shut the laptop, please? If your language processor is engaged browsing the web or reading your email, you're distracted. And worse yet, you distract all of the people around you. Studies have shown that. And worse yet, if I see a open laptop somewhere back there or up here, it drives me nuts, and I do a worse job. And so that ensures that all of your friends who are paying attention don't get the performance that they came to have. So that's it for preamble. Let's get started. First thing we talk about, of course, is how to start. Some people think the right thing to do is to start a talk with a joke. I don't recommend it, and the reason is that, in the beginning of a talk, people are still putting their laptops away. They're becoming adjusted to your speaking parameters, to your vocal parameters, and they're not ready for a joke. So it doesn't work very well. They usually fall flat. What you want to do instead is start with empowerment promise. You want to tell people what they're going to know at the end of the hour that they didn't know at the beginning of the hour. It's an empowerment promise. It's the reason for being here. What would be an example? Oh, I see. At the end of this 60 minutes, you will know things about speaking you don't know now, and something among those things you know will make a difference in your life. Yeah, that's an empowerment promise, so that's the best way to start. So now that I've talked a little bit about how to start, what I want to do is give you some samples of heuristics that are always on my mind when I give a talk, and first of these heuristics is that it's a good idea to cycle on the subject. Go around it. Go round it again. Go round it again. Some people say, tell him what you want to tell him. Tell him again, and then tell him a third time, as if people weren't intelligent. But the point is-- the reason is-- well, there are many reasons, one of which is, at any given moment, about 20% of you will be fogged out no matter what the lecture is. So if you want to ensure that the probability that everybody gets it is high, you need to say it three times. So cycling is one of the things that I always think about when I give a talk. Another thing I think about is, in explaining my idea, I want to build a fence around it so that it's not confused with somebody else's idea. So if you were from Mars, and I was teaching you about what an arch is, I might say to you, well, that's an arch. And that's not to be confused with some other things that other people might think is-- this is not an arch. That's not an arch. I'm building a fence around my idea so that it can be distinguished from somebody else's idea. So in a more technical sense, I might say, well, my algorithm might similar-- might seem similar to Jones's algorithm, except his is exponential, and mine's linear. That's putting a fence around your idea so that people can not be confused about how it might relate to something else. The third thing on this list of samples is the idea of verbal punctuation. And the idea here is that, because people will occasionally fog out and need to get back on the bus, you need to provide some landmark places where you're announcing that it's a good time to get back on. So I might, in this talk, say something about this being my outline. The first thing we're going to do is talk about how to start. Then we're going to deal with these four samples, and among these four samples, I've talked about the first idea-- that's cycling. The second idea, building-- and now, the third idea is verbal punctuation. So I'm enumerating and providing numbers. I'm giving you a sense that there's a seam in the talk, and you can get back on. So now, we're on a roll, and since we're on a roll, can you guess what fourth idea might be here-- an idea that helps people get back on the bus? AUDIENCE: Ask a question. PATRICK WINSTON: Yes? AUDIENCE: Ask a question. [INAUDIBLE] PATRICK WINSTON: Ask a question, yes. Thank you. So ask a question. And so I will ask a question-- how much dead air can there be? How long can I pause? I counted seven seconds. It seemed like an eternity to me to wait and not say anything for seven seconds, but that's the standard amount of time you can wait for an answer. And of course, the question has to be carefully chosen. It can't be too obvious because then people will be embarrassed to say it, but the answers can't be too hard because then nobody will have anything to say. So here are some sample heuristics you can put in your armamentarium and build up your repertoire of ideas about presentation. And now, if this persuades you that there is something to know, that there is knowledge, then I've already succeeded because what I want to convince you of, is if you watch the speakers you admire and feel are effective, and ask yourselves why they're successful, then you can build up your own personal repertoire and develop your own personal style. And that's my fundamental objective, and the rest of this talk is about some of the things that are in my armamentarium that I think are effective. So next thing on our agenda, as we start to discuss these other things, is a discussion of time and place. So what do you think is a good time to have a lecture? 11 AM? Yeah. And the reason is most people at MIT are awake by then, and hardly anyone has gone back to sleep. It's not right after a meal. People aren't fatigued from this or that. It's a great time to have a lecture. So that brings me, next, to the question of what about the place? And the most important thing about the place is that it be well lit. This room is well lit. Problem with other kinds of rooms is that we humans, whenever the lights go down, or whenever the room is dimly lighted, it signals that we should go to sleep. So whenever I go somewhere to give a talk, even today, the first thing I do when I speak to the audio-visual people is say, keep the lights full up. Oh, they might reply, people will see the slides better if we turn the lights off, and then I reply, it's extremely hard to see slides through closed eyelids. What else can you say about the place? Well, the place should be cased, and I mean that in a colloquial sense, of like if you're robbing a bank, you would go to the bank some occasions before to see what it's like, so there are no surprises when you do your robbery. So whenever I go somewhere to speak, the first thing I ask my host to do is to take me to the place where I'll be speaking so that if there are any weirdnesses, I'll be able to deal with it. Sometimes, it might require some intervention. Sometimes, it just might require me to understand what the challenges are. So when I came here this morning, I did what I typically do. I imagined that all the seats were filled with disinterested farm animals, and that way, I knew that, no matter how bad it was, it wouldn't be as bad as that. So finally, it should be reasonably-- it should be reasonably populated. It should be the case that-- if there were 10 people in this hall, everyone would be wondering, what's going on that's so much more interesting that nobody's here. So you want to get a right sized place that's-- doesn't have to be packed, but it has to be more than half full. So those are some thoughts about a time and place. Next thing I want to talk about is a subject of boards and props and slides. Well, these are the tools of the trade. I believe that this is the right tool for speaking when your purpose is informing. The slides are good when your purpose is exposing, but this is what I use when I'm informing, teaching, lecturing, and there's several reasons why I use it. For one thing, when you use the board, you have a graphic quality. It's the case that, when you have a board, then you can easily exploit the fact that you can use graphics in your presentation. So that's the graphic quality that I like, and the next thing I like is the speed property. The speed with which you write on the blackboard is approximately the speed at which people can absorb ideas. If you go flipping through a bunch of slides, nobody can go that fast. Finally, one great property of a board is that it can be a target. Many people who are novices at speaking find themselves suddenly aware of their hands. It's as if their hands were private parts that shouldn't be exposed in public, so right away, they go into the pockets, and this is considered insulting in some parts of the world. Or alternatively, maybe the hands will go in back like this. I was once in a convent in Serbia, and my host-- as soon as we entered, a nun came up to us and offered us a refreshment. And I was about to say, no, thank you, and he said, eat that stuff or die. It's a question of local custom and politeness. But then before anything happened there, the nun pulled my hands out like this because it was extraordinarily insulting in that culture to have your hands behind your back. So why is that? Well, it's usually supposed that that's that it has to do with whether you're concealing a weapon. So if your hands are in your pockets or behind your back, then it looks like you might have a weapon, and that's what I mean by the virtue-- one of these virtues of the board. Now, you have something to do with your hands. You can point out the stuff. I was once watching Seymour Papert give a lecture, and I thought it was terrific. So I went a second time-- first time to absorb the content, second time to note style. And what I discovered is that Papert was constantly pointing at the board. And then I thought about it a little while, and I noted that none of the stuff he was pointing to had anything to do with what he was saying. Nevertheless, it was an effective technique. So that's just a little bit about the virtue of blackboards. Now, I want to talk about props. The custodians of knowledge about props are the playwrights. Many decades ago, I saw a play by Henrik Ibsen. It was Hedda Gabler. I remember vaguely that it was about a woman in an unhappy marriage, and her husband was in competition for an academic job with somebody else. And he was going to lose partly because he was boring, and partly because the competitor had just written a magnificent book. By the way, this is back in the days before there were copying machines and computers. Anyhow, as the play opens, there's a potbellied stove, and in the beginning of the play, the potbelly stove, with its open door, just has some slightly glowing embers. But the potbellied stove is always there, and as tension mounts in the play, and you see this manuscript, this prop that Ibsen so artfully used, you just know that something's going to happen, because as the play goes on, the fire gets bigger and hotter and finally all consuming, and you just know that that manuscript is going to go into that fire. This memorable thing is what I remember about the play. So playwrights have got this all figured out, but on the other hand, they're not the only people who can use props. Here's an example of the use of a prop, also due to Seymour Papert. He was talking about how it's important to look at the problem in the right way, and here's an example that not only teaches that, but makes it possible for you to embarrass your friends in mechanical engineering. So here's what you do. Take a bicycle wheel, and you start it spinning. And then you put some torque on the axle, or equivalently, you blow on the edge. And the issue is, does it go that way, or does it go that way? Now, the mechanical engineers will immediately say, oh, yes, I see-- right hand screw wheel. And they'll put their fingers in this position, but forget exactly how to align their fingers with the various aspects of the problem. And so it's usually the case that they get it right with about a 50% probability. So their very fancy education gets them up to the point where they're equivalent to flipping a coin. But it doesn't have to be that way because you can think about the problem a little differently. So here's what you do. You take some duct tape, and you put it around the part of the wheel like that. And now, you start to think about, not the whole wheel, but just a little piece that's underneath the duct tape. So here, that piece comes rolling over the top, and at this point, you blow on it with a puff of air. Forgetting about the rest of the wheel, what happens to that little piece that's under the duct tape? It must want to go that way because you banged on it like that. It's already going down like that. And what about the next piece? Same thing. Next piece? Same thing. So the only thing that can happen is that the wheel goes over like that. And so now, you'll never wonder again because you're thinking about the problem in the right way, and it's demonstrated by the use of a prop. You can try this after we're done. Another example I like to remember is one from when I was taking 8.01. Alan Lazarus was the instructor at the time, and he was talking about the conservation of energy, kinetic and potential. And there was a long wire in a ceiling in 26-100 attached to a much bigger steel ball, but one-- not one like this. And Lazarus took the ball up against the wall like this. He put his head flat against the wall to steady himself, and then he let go, and the pendulum takes many seconds to go over and back, and then gently kisses Lazarus's nose. And so you have many seconds to think, this guy really believes in the conservation of energy. Do not try this at home. The problem is that, the first time you do this, you may not just let go. There's a natural human tendency to push. So that's a little bit on a subject of props. It's interesting. Whenever surveys are taken, students always say more chalk, less PowerPoint. And why would that be? Props are also very effective. Why would that be? I'll give you my lunatic fringe view on this. It has to do with what I would call empathetic mirroring. When you're sitting up there watching me write on the board, all those little mirror neurons in your head, I believe, become actuated, and you can feel yourself writing on the blackboard. And even more so, when I talk about this steel ball going that way and this way, you can feel the ball as if you were me, and you can't do that with a slide. You can't do it with a picture. You need to see it in the physical world. That's why I think that-- oh, yes, of course, it's-- there are speed questions involved, too, that have to be separated out. But I think the empathetic mirroring is why props and the use of a blackboard are so effective. Well, let's see-- oh, yes, there is one more thing by way of the tools, and that has to do with the use of slides. I repeat, I think they're for exposing ideas, not for teaching ideas, but that's what we do in a job talk or conference talk-- expose ideas. We don't teach them. So let me tell you a little bit about my views on that. I remember, once, I was in Terminal A at Logan Airport. I'd just come back from a really miserable conference, and the flight was really horrible. It was one of those that feels like an unbalanced washing machine. And for the only time in my life, I decided to stop on my way to my car and have a cup of coffee and relax a little bit. And as I was there for a few minutes, someone came up to me and said, are you Professor Winston? I think so, I said. I don't know. I guess I was trying to be funny. In any event, he said, I'm on my way to Europe to give a job talk. Would you mine critiquing my slides? Not at all, I said. You have too many, and they have too many words. How did you know, he said, thinking perhaps I had seen a talk of his before. I hadn't. My reply was, because it's always true. There are always too many slides, always too many words. So let me show you some extreme examples of how not to use slides. Well, for this demonstration, I need to be way over here and when I get over here, then I can start to say things like, one of the things you shouldn't do is read your transparencies. People in your audience know how to read, and reading will just annoy them. Also, you should be sure that you have only a few words on each transparency, and that the words are easy to read. And I hope I'm driving you crazy because I'm committing all kinds of crimes, the first of which is that there are too many words on the slide. Second of which is, I'm way over there, and the slide's way over there. So you get into this tennis match feeling of shifting back and forth between the slide and the speaker. You want the slides to be condiments to what you're saying, not the main event or the opposite way around. So how can we fix this? Step number one is to get rid of the background junk. That's always distraction. Step number two is to get rid of the words. When I reduced the words to these, then everything I read a previous time, I'm not licensed to say, because it's not on the slide. I'm not reading my slides anymore, but I'm saying what was written on the slides in a previous example. So what else can we do to simplify this? Well, we can get rid of the logos. We don't need them. Simplification. What else can we do? Get rid of the title. Now, I want to talk to you about some rules for slide preparation. I'm telling you the title. It doesn't have to be up there. By reducing the number of words on the slide, I'm allowing you to pay more attention to me and less to what's written on the slide. I mentioned it before-- we-- have only one language processor, and we can either use it to read stuff or to listen to the speaker. And so if we have too many words on the slide, it forces people in the audience to read this stuff and not listen. A student of mine did an experiment a few years ago. He taught some students some web-based programming ideas. Half the information was on slides, he said the other half, and then for a control group, he reversed it. And the question was, what did the subjects-- that is to say, freshmen at his fraternity-- what did the subjects remember best, what he said, or what they read on the slide? And the answer is, what they read on the slide. When their slides have a lot of material on it, they don't pay attention to the speaker. In fact, in the after action report, one of the subjects said, I wish you hadn't talked so much. It was distracting. Well, the last item is eliminate clutter. Here's some clutter. No reason even for those bullets. So the too many words problem is a consequence of a crime Microsoft has committed by allowing you to use fonts that are too small. So you should all have a sample slide like this that you can use to determine what the minimum font size is that's easily legible. [INAUDIBLE],, what do you think of those? AUDIENCE: Which size is right? PATRICK WINSTON: What's that? AUDIENCE: Did you ask me what size is right? PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, minimum, maybe. AUDIENCE: 40 or 50. PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, he says 40 or 50. I think that's about right. 35 is beginning to get too small, not necessarily because you can't read it, but because you're probably using it to get too many words on the slide. What other crimes do we have? Well, we have the laser pointer crime. And for that-- in the old days, when we didn't have laser pointers, we used wooden ones, and people would go waving these things around. And pretty soon it became almost like a baton twirling contest, so here's what I recommended in the old days for dealing with this kind of pointer. This is an example of use of a prop. Jim Glass up there saw this talk about 20 years ago, and said, oh, yeah, I remember that talk. That's the one where you broke the pointer. It's amazing how props tend to be the things that are remembered. Well, now, we don't have physical pointers anymore. We've got laser pointers. It's a wonder more people aren't driven into epileptic fits over this sort of stuff. Well, here's what tends to happen. Look at that. It's a lovely recursive picture, and I can become part of it by putting that laser beam right on the back of my head up there. Then what do you see? You see the back of my head. I have no eye contact, no engagement, nothing. I was sitting with a student watching a talk one day, and she said, you know what, we could all leave, and he wouldn't know. So what happens when you use a laser pointer? You can't use a laser pointer without turning your head and pointing it at something, and when you do that, you lose contact with the audience. You don't want to do it. So what do you do if you need to identify something in your image, and you don't want to point at it with a laser? This is what you do. Put a little arrow on there and say, now, look at that guy at the end of arrow number one. You don't need to have laser pointer to do that. The too-heavy crime-- when people ask me to review a presentation, I ask them to print it out and lay it out on a table. When they do that, it's easy to see whether the talk is too heavy, too much text, not enough air, not enough white space, not enough imagery. This is a good example of such a talk-- way too heavy. The presenter has taken advantage of a small font sizes to get as much on the slide as he wanted. Lots of other crimes here, but the too-heavy-- the fact that it's too heavy is what I wanted to illustrate. So here, by contrast, another talk-- one I gave a few years ago. It's not-- it wasn't a deeply technical talk, but I show it to you because there's air in it. It's mostly pictures of things. There are three or four slides that have text on them, but when I come to those, I give the audience time to read them. And they're there because they might have some historical significance. The first slide with a lot of text on it is an extraction from the 1957-- from the proposal for the 1957 AI conference at Dartmouth. Extraordinarily interesting event, and that historical extraction from the proposal helps drive that point home. What else have we got here? Oh, yeah, your vocabulary word for the day. This is an hapax legomenon. What that means is, this is the kind of slide you can get away with exactly once in your presentation. This is a slide that got some currency some years ago because it shows the complexity of governing in Afghanistan by showing how impossibly complex it is. It's something you in the audience can't understand, and that's the point, but you can't have many of these. You can have one per work, one per presentation, one per paper, one per book. That's what hapax legomenon is, and this is an example of it. Well, I've shown you some crimes. So you might be asking, do these crimes actually occur? So they do. [LAUGHTER] There's the hands in the pockets crime. There's a crime and time and place selection here. This is how you get to the Bartos Theater. First thing you do is you get on these steps over at the Media Lab, then you cross this large open space, then you turn right down this corridor. [LAUGHTER] At this point, whenever I go in there, I wonder if there are torture implements around the corner. [LAUGHTER] And then when you get in there, you get into this dark, gloomy place. So it's well named when they call it the Bartos Theater because it's a place where you can watch a movie, but it's not a place where you can give a talk. Now, on a subject of does it happen, here's a talk I attended a while back in Stata. Notice that the speaker is far away from the slides. Speaker's using a laser pointer. And you say to me, well, what's happening here? It's, by the way, the 80th - 80th! slide of the presentation. Notice that it extends with the words, this is the first of 10 conclusions slides. [LAUGHTER] So what's the audience reaction? That's the sponsor of the meeting. [LAUGHTER] He's reading his email. This is the co-sponsor of the meeting. He's examining the lunch menu. [LAUGHTER] What about this person? This person looks like he's paying attention, but just because it's a still picture. If you were to see a video, what you would see is something like this [YAWNS]. [LAUGHTER] So yeah, it does happen. Well, now, that's a quick review of tools. Now, I want to talk about some special cases. We could talk a little bit about the informing or to say another way, doing what I'm doing now. But I'll just say a few words about that. In that kind of presentation, you want to start with a promise like I did for this hour that we're going through now. And then it comes to the question of how do you inspire people? I've given this talk for a long time, and a few years ago, our department chairman said, would you please give this talk to a new faculty, and be sure to emphasize what it takes to inspire students. And strangely, I hadn't thought about that question before. So I started a survey. I'd talked to some of my incoming freshmen advisees, and I talked to senior faculty and everything in between about how they've been inspired. What I found from the incoming freshmen is that they were inspired by some high school teacher who told them they could do it. What I found in the senior faculty, they were inspired by someone who helped them see a problem in a new way. And what I saw from everyone is that they were inspired when someone exhibited passion about what they were doing, exhibited passion about what they were doing. So that's one way to be inspiring. It's easy for me because I do artificial intelligence. And how can you not be interested in artificial intelligence? [LAUGHTER] I mean, if you're not interested in artificial intelligence, you're probably not interested in interesting things. So when I'm lecturing in my AI class, it's natural for me to talk about what I think is cool and how exciting some new idea is. So that's the kind of expression of passion that makes a difference while informing with respect to this question of inspiring. Oh, yeah and of course, during this promise phase, you can also express how cool stuff is. Let me give you an example of a lecture that starts this way. I'm talking about resource allocation. It's the same sort of stuff you would think of when your-- it's the same sort of ideas you would need if you're allocating aircraft to a flight schedule or trying to schedule a factory or something like that. But the example is putting colors on the states in the United States without any bordering states having the same color. So here it goes. This is what I show at the beginning of the class. This is a way of doing that coloring. And you might say, well, why don't we wait till it finishes? Would you like to do that? No? Well, we're not going to wait till it finishes because the sun will have exploded and consumed the earth before this program finishes. [LAUGHTER] But with a slight adjustment to how the program works, which I tell my students you will understand in the next 50 minutes, this is what you get. Isn't that cool? You got to be amazed by stuff that takes a computation from longer than the lifetime of the solar system into a few seconds. So that's what I mean by providing a promise upfront and expressing some passion about what you're talking about. Well, the last item in this little block here is it has to do with what people think that they do it at MIT. You ask faculty what the most important purpose is, and they'll say, well, the most important thing I do is teach people how to think. And then you say oh, that's great. How do you teach people how to think? Blank stare. No one can quite respond to that part, that natural next question. So how do you teach people how to think? Well, I believe that we are storytelling animals. And that we start developing our story, understanding and manipulating skills with fairy tales in childhood and continue on through professional schools like law, business, medicine, everything. And we continue doing that throughout life. So if that is what thinking is all about. And we want to teach people how to think, you provide them with the stories they need to know, the questions they need to ask about those stories, mechanisms for analyzing those stories, ways of putting stories together, ways of evaluating how reliable a story is. And that's what I think you need to do when you teach people how to think. But that's all about education. And many of you here are not necessarily for that, but rather for this part, for persuading, which breaks down into several categories, oral exams, not shown, shop talks, getting famous. I won't say much about oral exams other than the fact that they used to be a lot scarier than they are today. In the old days, reading the literature in a foreign language was a part of that. And there was a high failure rate. And when you look back on those failures, the most usual reason for people failing an oral exam is failure to situate and a failure to practice. By situate, I mean, it's important to talk about your research in context. This is a problem that's being pursued all over the world. There hasn't been any progress before me in the past 30 years. Everyone is looking for a solution because it will have impact on so many other things, such situating and time and place and feel. And then as far as practice is concerned, yes, practice is important. But that doesn't mean showing your slides to the people you share an with. The problem with that is that if people know what you're doing, they will hallucinate that there's material in your presentation that isn't there if it isn't there. A variation on the scene, by the way, is your faculty supervisor is not a very good person to help you debug a talk because they, in fact, know what you're doing. And they will, in fact, hallucinate there's material in your presentation that isn't there. So you need to get together with some friends who don't know what you're doing and have them-- well, you start the practice session by saying, if you can't make me cry, I won't value as a friend anymore. [LAUGHTER] And then when you get to the faculty on a oral exam, it will be easy. You see, difficulty-- the amount of flak you'll get from somebody is proportional to age. The older somebody is, the more they understand where they are in the world. But the young people are trying to show the old people how smart they are, so it's subtly vicious. So whenever you have an opportunity to have an examining committee that's full of people with gray hair, that's what you want. Well, that's just a word or two about something I haven't listed here. Let's get into the subject of job talks. So I was sitting in a bar many years ago in San Diego. I was a member of the Navy Science Board, and I was sitting with a couple of my colleagues on the board Delores Etter from the University of Colorado. She made me so jealous I could spit because she'd written 21 books, and I'd only written 17. And then the other one was Bill Weldon from the University of Texas. He was an electromagnetism guy, and he knew how to use rail guns to drive steel rods through tank armor. These were interesting people. So I said, what do you look for in a faculty candidate? And within one microsecond, Delores said, they have to show us they've got some kind of vision, quickly followed by Bill who said, they have to show us that they've done something. Oh, that sounds good, I said. And then I said to them, how long does a candidate have to establish these two things? What do you think? Well, compare your answer to theirs. Five minutes. So if you haven't expressed your vision, if you haven't told people that you've done something in five minutes, you've already lost. So you have to be able to do that. And let me just mention a couple of things in that connection. Here, the vision is in part, a problem that somebody cares about and something new in your approach. So the problem is understanding the nature of human intelligence. And the approach is asking questions about what makes us different from chimpanzees and Neanderthals. Is it merely a matter of quantity, or we're just a little bit smarter in some continuous way? Or do we have something that's fundamentally different that chimpanzees don't have and Neanderthals either? And the answer is yes, we do have something different. We are symbolic creatures. And because we're symbolic creatures, we can build symbolic descriptions of relations and events. We can string them together and make stories. And because we can make stories, that's what makes us different. So that's my stump speech. That's how I start most of my talks on my own personal research. How do you express the notion that you've done something? By listing the steps that need to be taken in order to achieve the solution to that problem. You don't have to have done all of those steps. But you can say here's what needs to be done. An example, here's what needs to be done. We need to specify some behavior. We need to enumerate the constraints that make it possible to deal with that behavior. We have to implement a system because we're engineers, and we don't think that we've understood something unless we can build it. And we've built such a system, and we're about to demonstrate it to you today. That would be an example of enumerating a series of steps needed to realize the vision. So then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you conclude by-- you conclude by enumerating your contributions. It's kind of mirror of these steps. And it helps to establish that you've done something. So that's a kind of general purpose framework for doing a technical talk. Now, only a few more things left to do today. Getting famous is the next item on our agenda because once you've got the job, you need to think a little bit about how you're going to be recognized for what you do. So oh, first of all, why should you care about getting famous? I thought about this in connection with a fundraising event I attended once, a fundraising event for raising money to save Venice from going under water and having all of its art destroyed. Anyway, I was sitting here, and JC was sitting here. That was Julia, the late Julia Child. And as the evening wore on, more and more people would come up and ask Julia to autograph something or express a feeling that she had changed their life. And it just happened over and over again. So eventually, I turned to Julia, and I said, Ms. Child, is it fun to be famous? And she thought about it for a second. And she said, you get used to it. [LAUGHTER] But you know what occured to me? You never get used to being ignored. So it's-- here's a way to think about it. Your ideas are like your children. And you don't want them to go into the world in rags. So what you want to do is to be sure that you have these techniques, these mechanisms, these thoughts about how to present ideas that you have so that they're recognized for the value that is in them. So that's why it's a legitimate thing to concern yourself with packaging. Now, how do you get remembered? Well, there's something I like to call Winston's star. And every one of the items I'm about to articulate starts with an S. So if you want your presentation ideas to be remembered, one of the things you need to do is to make sure that you have some kind of symbol associated with your work. So this arch example is actually from my PhD thesis many, many years ago. And in the course of my work at that time, this work on arch learning became mildly famous, and I didn't know why. It was only many years later that I realized that that work accidentally had all of the elements on this star. So the first element is that there was a kind of symbol. It's the arch itself. Next thing you need is some kind of slogan, a kind of phrase that provides a handle on the work. And in this case, the phrase was one shot learning. And it was one shot because the program I wrote learned something definite from every example that was presented to us. So in going from a model based on this configuration to something that isn't an arch base on that configuration, the program learned that it has to be on top, one shot learning. So that's a symbol, slogan. And now we need a surprise. Yeah, the surprise is you don't need a million examples of something to learn. You can do it with one example if you're smart enough to make use of that example appropriately. So that was the surprise. You can learn something definite from each example. Next item was a salient idea. Now, when I say salient idea, I don't mean important. What I mean is an idea that sticks out. Some theses, funnily enough, have too many good ideas, and you don't know what it's all about because which one is it? So you need an idea that sticks out. And the idea that stuck out here was the notion of a near miss. You see, this is not an arch, but it doesn't miss by much. So it's a near miss. And finally, you need to tell the story of how you did it, how it works, why it's important. So that's a bit on how to not so much get famous, but how to ensure that your work is recognized. Well, we're almost finished because now we're down to this last item, which is how to stop. And when we come to that, there's a question of all right, well, what is the final slide? And what are the final words? So for the final slide, let me give you some examples of possibilities. How about this one? Well, you might see that slide and think to yourself, there are 1,000 faculty at MIT. Nice piece of work, but not so much, but it's only a tiny piece of work if you divide by 1,000. So when you show a whole gigantic list of collaborators at the end of a talk, it's a kind of let down because it suggests that nobody knows. Well, did you do anything significant? Now, you've got to recognize your collaborators, right? So where do you do that? Not on the last slide, on the first slide. All this was on the first slide. These are the collaborators, so you don't want to put them at the end. You don't want a slide like this. How about this one? This is the worst possible way to end a talk. [LAUGHTER] Because this slide can be up there for 20 minutes. I've seen it happen. It squanders real estate. It squanders an opportunity to tell people who you are. It's just-- What about this one? I often see it. I never see anybody write it down. Also, it wastes opportunity. Oh my God, even worse. All of these lines do nothing for you. They waste an opportunity for you to tell people-- to leave people with what you-- with who you are. Well, what about this? Is this a good one? It might seem so at first, but here's the problem. If you say these are my conclusions, these are perfectly legitimate conclusions that nobody cares about. What they care about is what you have done. And that's why your final slide should have this label, contributions. It's a mirror of what I said over there about how job talks ought to be like a sandwich. And the final slide, the one that's up there while people are asking questions and filing out, it ought to be the one that has your contributions on it. Here's an example from my own stump speech. Yeah, this is what I talk about a lot. Yes, here are the things that I typically demonstrate. And I wait for people to read it. And the final element there is this is what we get out of it, so that's an example of a contribution slide. All right, now, what about the other part? You got your final slide up there. It's a contribution slide. Somehow you have to tell people you're finished. So let's see it, check out a few possibilities. One thing you could do in the final words is you could tell a joke. It's OK. By the time you're done, people have adjusted themselves to your voice parameters. They're ready for a joke. I was sitting in another bar, this time in Austin, Texas with a colleague of mine named Doug Lenat. And Doug's a fantastic speaker. And so I said to Doug, Doug, you're a fantastic speaker, what's your secret? And he said, oh, I always finish with a joke, and that way, people think they've had fun the whole time. [LAUGHTER] So yeah, a joke will work down there. How about this one? Thank you. I don't recommend it. It's a weak move. You will not go to hell if you conclude your talk by saying thank you, but it's a weak move, and here's why. When you say thank you, even worse, thank you for listening, it suggests that everybody has stayed that long out of politeness and that they had a profound desire to be somewhere else. But they're so polite, they stuck it out. And that's what you're thanking them for. So once wild applause has started, you can mouth a thank you, and there's nothing wrong with that. But the last thing you do should not be saying thank you. Now, you say to me, well, doesn't everybody say thank you? Well, what everybody does is not necessarily the right thing. And I like to illustrate how some talks can end without saying thank you. I like to draw from political speeches, but the ones that I've heard recently aren't so good, so-- [LAUGHTER] So I'm going to have to go go back a little bit. So here is Governor Christie. He gave the Republican keynote address one year. This is the end of his talk. Let's see what he does. [APPLAUSE] CHRIS CHRISTIE: And together, everybody, together. We will stand up once again for American greatness for our children and grandchildren. God bless you, and God bless America. [APPLAUSE] PATRICK WINSTON: So that's a classic benediction ending. God bless you, God bless America. Now, I don't want to be partisan about this. So I think I'd better switch to the keynote address in the Democratic Convention. It was delivered that year by Bill Clinton, who knows something about how to speak. [APPLAUSE] BILL CLINTON: If that is what you want, if that is what you believe, you must vote, and you must re-elect President Barack Obama. God bless you, and God bless America. [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] PATRICK WINSTON: Now, watch this. Let's go back a little bit and redo it. What I want you to see is that at one point, he seems to be almost pressing his lips together, forcing himself not to say thank you. Then there's another place where he does a little salute. So watch for those this time around. [APPLAUSE] BILL CLINTON: If that is what you want, if that is what you believe, you must vote, and you must re-elect President Barack Obama. God bless you., and God bless America. [APPLAUSE] PATRICK WINSTON: That's where he's pursing his lips. [LAUGHTER] There's the salute. [LAUGHTER] Yeah, I think that's pretty good. Now, what are we gonna take away from this? Well, I suppose I could conclude this talk by saying God bless you, and God bless the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but it might not work so well. But what you can get out of this is you don't have to say thank you. There are other things you can do. And it's interesting that over time, people figure this out, and there's some stock ways of ending things. So in the Catholic church, and the good old Latin mass, it ended with ite missa est, which translates approximately to OK, the mass is over, you can go home now. [LAUGHTER] And of course, at musical concerts, you know that it's time to clap not at the end of the song, but rather when the conductor goes over and shakes hands with the concert master. Those are conventions that tell you that the event is over. So those are all possibilities for here. But one more possibility, and that is that you can salute the audience. And by that, I mean, you can say something about how much you value your time at a place. So I could say, well, it's been great fun being here. It's been fascinating to see what you folks are doing here at MIT. I've been much stimulated and provoked by the kinds of questions you've been asking, it's been really great. And I look forward to coming back on many occasions in the future. So that salutes the audience. You can do that. Well, there it is. You know what? I'm glad you're here. And the reason is by being here, I think you have demonstrated an understanding that how you present and how you package your ideas is an important thing. And I salute you for that. [LAUGHTER] And I suggest that you come back again and bring your friends.

qp0HIF3SfI4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4,How Great Leaders Inspire Action | Simon Sinek | TED,"How do you explain when things don't go as we assume? Or better, how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions? For example: Why is Apple so innovative? Year after year, after year, they're more innovative than all their competition. And yet, they're just a computer company. They're just like everyone else. They have the same access to the same talent, the same agencies, the same consultants, the same media. Then why is it that they seem to have something different? Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement? He wasn't the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America, and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day. Why him? And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified, better funded -- and they didn't achieve powered man flight, and the Wright brothers beat them to it. There's something else at play here. About three and a half years ago, I made a discovery. And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked, and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it. As it turns out, there's a pattern. As it turns out, all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world, whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers, they all think, act and communicate the exact same way. And it's the complete opposite to everyone else. All I did was codify it, and it's probably the world's simplest idea. I call it the golden circle. Why? How? What? This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't. Let me define the terms really quickly. Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent. Some know how they do it, whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP. But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do. And by ""why"" I don't mean ""to make a profit."" That's a result. It's always a result. By ""why,"" I mean: What's your purpose? What's your cause? What's your belief? Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? And why should anyone care? As a result, the way we think, we act, the way we communicate is from the outside in, it's obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations -- regardless of their size, regardless of their industry -- all think, act and communicate from the inside out. Let me give you an example. I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it. If Apple were like everyone else, a marketing message from them might sound like this: ""We make great computers. They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. Want to buy one?"" ""Meh."" That's how most of us communicate. That's how most marketing and sales are done, that's how we communicate interpersonally. We say what we do, we say how we're different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that. Here's our new law firm: We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients, we always perform for our clients. Here's our new car: It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats. Buy our car. But it's uninspiring. Here's how Apple actually communicates. ""Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?"" Totally different, right? You're ready to buy a computer from me. I just reversed the order of the information. What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do; people buy why you do it. This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple. But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple, or a DVR from Apple. As I said before, Apple's just a computer company. Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors. Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products. In fact, they tried. A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs. They're eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs. They've been making flat-screen monitors for years. Nobody bought one. Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs, and they make great quality products, and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one. In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell. Why would you buy one from a computer company? But we do it every day. People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe. Here's the best part: None of what I'm telling you is my opinion. It's all grounded in the tenets of biology. Not psychology, biology. If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, from the top down, the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle. Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain, our neocortex, corresponds with the ""what"" level. The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections make up our limbic brains, and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings, like trust and loyalty. It's also responsible for all human behavior, all decision-making, and it has no capacity for language. In other words, when we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures. It just doesn't drive behavior. When we can communicate from the inside out, we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where gut decisions come from. Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, ""I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right."" Why would we use that verb, it doesn't ""feel"" right? Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn't control language. The best we can muster up is, ""I don't know.  It just doesn't feel right."" Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or soul. I hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior. It's all happening here in your limbic brain, the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language. But if you don't know why you do what you do, and people respond to why you do what you do, then how will you ever get people to vote for you, or buy something from you, or, more importantly, be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do. The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe. The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hire people who believe what you believe. I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money, but if they believe what you believe, they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears. Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers. Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley. And back in the early 20th century, the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day. Everybody was trying it. And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume, to be the recipe for success. Even now, you ask people, ""Why did your product or why did your company fail?"" and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things: under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions. It's always the same three things, so let's explore that. Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine. Money was no problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected; he knew all the big minds of the day. He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic. The New York Times followed him around everywhere, and everyone was rooting for Langley. Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley? A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success. They had no money; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop. Not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education, not even Orville or Wilbur. And The New York Times followed them around nowhere. The difference was, Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief. They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine, it'll change the course of the world. Samuel Pierpont Langley was different. He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous. He was in pursuit of the result. He was in pursuit of the riches. And lo and behold, look what happened. The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears. The others just worked for the paycheck. They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out, they would have to take five sets of parts, because that's how many times they would crash before supper. And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903, the Wright brothers took flight, and no one was there to even experience it. We found out about it a few days later. And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing: the day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit. He could have said, ""That's an amazing discovery, guys, and I will improve upon your technology,"" but he didn't. He wasn't first, he didn't get rich, he didn't get famous, so he quit. People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. If you talk about what you believe, you will attract those who believe what you believe. But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe? Something called the law of diffusion of innovation, if you don't know the law, you know the terminology. The first 2.5% of our population are our innovators. The next 13.5% of our population are our early adopters. The next 34% are your early majority, your late majority and your laggards. The only reason these people buy touch-tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore. (Laughter) We all sit at various places at various times on this scale, but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea, you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration, and then the system tips. I love asking businesses, ""What's your conversion on new business?"" They love to tell you, ""It's about 10 percent,"" proudly. Well, you can trip over 10% of the customers. We all have about 10% who just ""get it."" That's how we describe them, right? That's like that gut feeling, ""Oh, they just get it."" The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it before doing business versus the ones who don't get it? So it's this here, this little gap that you have to close, as Jeffrey Moore calls it, ""Crossing the Chasm"" -- because, you see, the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first. And these guys, the innovators and the early adopters, they're comfortable making those gut decisions. They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available. These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out, when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week. These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars on flat-screen TVs when they first came out, even though the technology was substandard. And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great; they did it for themselves. It's because they wanted to be first. People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe. In fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe. The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours, stood in line for six hours, was because of what they believed about the world, and how they wanted everybody to see them: they were first. People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. So let me give you a famous example, a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation. First, the famous failure. It's a commercial example. As we said before, the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions. You should have success then. Look at TiVo. From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day, they are the single highest-quality product on the market, hands down, there is no dispute. They were extremely well-funded. Market conditions were fantastic. I mean, we use TiVo as verb. I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time. (Laughter) But TiVo's a commercial failure. They've never made money. And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10. In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six, except for a couple of little spikes. Because you see, when TiVo launched their product, they told us all what they had. They said, ""We have a product that pauses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking."" And the cynical majority said, ""We don't believe you. We don't need it. We don't like it. You're scaring us."" What if they had said, ""If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, boy, do we have a product for you. It pauses live TV, skips commercials, memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."" People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it, and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe. Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation. In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak. They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date. How do you do that? Well, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator. He wasn't the only man in America who suffered in a pre-civil rights America. In fact, some of his ideas were bad. But he had a gift. He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America. He went around and told people what he believed. ""I believe, I believe, I believe,"" he told people. And people who believed what he believed took his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people. And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people. And lo and behold, 250,000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak. How many of them showed up for him? Zero. They showed up for themselves. It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August. It's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white: 25% of the audience was white. Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world: those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men. And not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority will we live in a just world. It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life. We followed, not for him, but for ourselves. By the way, he gave the ""I have a dream"" speech, not the ""I have a plan"" speech. (Laughter) Listen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans. They're not inspiring anybody. Because there are leaders and there are those who lead. Leaders hold a position of power or authority, but those who lead inspire us. Whether they're individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead, not because we have to, but because we want to. We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves. And it's those who start with ""why"" that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them. Thank you very much.

arj7oStGLkU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU,Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator | Tim Urban | TED,"So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So, you know -- (Laughter) you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil. (Laughter) And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this. (Laughter) And that would happen every single paper. But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light, and I'd bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase. How hard could it be to walk up the stairs? No big deal, right? But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan. (Laughter) And then -- (Laughter) But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters -- humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters -- sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline. I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call, and it's the school. And they say, ""Is this Tim Urban?"" And I say, ""Yeah."" And they say, ""We need to talk about your thesis."" And I say, ""OK."" And they say, ""It's the best one we've ever seen."" (Laughter) (Applause) That did not happen. (Laughter) It was a very, very bad thesis. (Laughter) I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, ""This guy is amazing!"" (Laughter) No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here to show you today. I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator. (Laughter) Now ... here's my brain. (Laughter) There is a difference. Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. [This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!] So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, ""Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened. (Laughter) Then -- (Laughter) Then we're going to go over to the fridge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. (Laughter) ""All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today. Sorry!"" (Sigh) Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun. Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success! (Laughter) And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK. But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times. We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long-term plans. And he wants to take all of that into account. And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. And that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground. (Laughter) Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred -- all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen? Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments -- someone called the Panic Monster. (Laughter) Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence. And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk. (Laughter) Now, of course, I said yes. It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past. (Laughter) (Applause) But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind. He was saying, ""Are we clear on what we just accepted? Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now."" And the Monkey said, ""Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India."" (Laughter) So that's what we did that day. (Laughter) As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speakers. And I opened up the website, and there was my face staring right back at me. And guess who woke up? (Laughter) So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem. (Laughter) And the Monkey -- remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster -- boom, he's up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk. Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. And this entire situation, with the three characters -- this is the procrastinator's system. It's not pretty, but in the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago. When I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things. These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students. (Laughter) And they were all writing, saying the same thing: ""I have this problem too."" But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on? Why are all of these people in such a dark place? Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines. And when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved. But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter -- something in the arts, something entrepreneurial -- there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum, get things going. There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn't working. Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; they just extend outward forever. And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind. It's usually suffered quietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets. And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming for some project. It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives. The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams; it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them. So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany -- that I don't think non-procrastinators exist. That's right -- I think all of you are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us, (Laughter) and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there. Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a Life Calendar. That's one box for every week of a 90-year life. That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar. We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today. Well, maybe not today, but ... (Laughter) You know. Sometime soon. Thank you.

tXLoBs0ipsI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXLoBs0ipsI,"It took 20 years, but we finally found it","- What you're looking at is a signal scientists have been searching for for over 20 years. It's a direct message from the nucleus of the isotope thorium-229, and in a breakthrough, they've finally found it. Why have they been searching for this, and what does it mean now that they've found it? This could help unlock the fundamental laws of the universe. You might not know this, but it's long been suspected that the fundamental constants of our universe, those foundational numbers we assume never change, are actually changing by tiny amounts. If they shift, even slightly, it could transform our understanding of physics, giving us clues about dark matter, extra dimensions from string theory, or even a fifth force. Scientists have been trying to measure changes in the fundamental constants for decades, but our measuring equipment hasn't been sensitive enough. But now, this signal is the key to creating the world's first nuclear clock, a device precise enough to detect changes that have previously been impossible to measure. Once it's complete, this clock could open a gateway to new physics, challenging longstanding theories about our universe. In this video, we'll discuss this discovery and its implications for science. But before we dive in, let's quickly recap. What are fundamental constants and why do they matter so much? Fundamental constants are fixed numbers that exist in the universe. They set the stage for how the laws of physics work. Some examples are the speed of light, which places a limit on how fast we can travel or send information, Boltzmann's constant, which governs the relationship between temperature and energy, and the gravitational constant, which dictates how strongly two masses attract each other through gravity. Physicists have boiled down the fundamental constants that shape our universe to just 26 numbers. Our current theory of known matter, the standard model, treats these numbers as unchanging in both space and time. The funny thing about fundamental constants is that they can't be predicted from theory. That's what makes them, well, fundamental. They have to be experimentally measured. Nature kind of just has to tell us what they are, and no one knows why they have the values that they do. As far as we know, these numbers are just written into the fabric of the universe. Even though they're a bit of a mystery, the constants aren't causing any trouble. Or, so we thought. Theories are starting to arise that are making scientists question the constantness of the constants. (bright music) Theories linked to some of physics's deepest unsolved problems. For example, they couldn't help but notice that many of the constants have the exact perfect values to support life. If some of them are off by even the tiniest amount, life as we know it probably wouldn't exist. Take this one, the fine-structure constant. It's not as famous as some of its constant cousins, like the speed of light, but it's a favorite among scientists. Richard Feynman once said, ""All good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it."" It combines the electron's charge, the vacuum permittivity, Planck's constant, and the speed of light, and has the value of about 1/137. Just like the gravitational constant tells us the strength of gravity, the fine-structure constant tells us the strength of electromagnetism. It's a pretty big deal, because electromagnetism affects, well, electricity and magnetism, which is also light, friction, and basically all of chemistry. Now, what's crazy is that its value lies in a perfect sweet spot. It's strong enough to bind electrons to the atom's nucleus, but loose enough to let them whizz around and interact with other atoms, performing chemical reactions, which are kind of the basis of life. If alpha were just a tiny bit weaker, electrons wouldn't bind to the nucleus at all. But if alpha were just a tiny bit stronger, electrons couldn't move freely and no chemistry would happen. It seems to lie in this perfect Goldilock zone for life to exist. How did that happen? Why is our universe so perfect for life to exist? Well, a theory that's been proposed to explain this puzzle is if the constants vary in space and time and life appeared in a part of the universe where the constants were the exact right values to support life, that would explain the extremely improbable chances of us being alive to measure them. Another reason some scientists think the constants might vary is because of newer theories of physics, like string theory, which tries to unify gravity and quantum mechanics, one of the biggest unresolved challenges in physics. These theories involve extra spatial dimensions to our current theories, and we would perceive changes to these spatial dimensions as the fundamental constants changing. And the final theory that the constants might be changing comes from the study of dark matter. Dark matter is the mysterious matter that accounts for over 20% of the universe's mass, yet we know almost nothing about it. Some physicists think that dark matter interacts very weakly with an atom's electrons or nucleus, causing alpha to drift or oscillate by some extremely tiny amount. If we observe this drift, it could help us understand dark matter. What's amazing is that we actually already have some indication for variations in alpha. In galaxies far, far away, there are super bright objects called quasars. These are supermassive black holes that suck in gas like a whirlpool. As the gas gets sucked in, it heats up due to friction, and this makes it shine super bright. In fact, quasars are some of the brightest objects in the universe. To measure variations in alpha, we can look at the light coming from distant quasars, quasars so far away that their light took several billion years to reach us. How? Well, as their light heads toward earth, it runs into gas clouds along the way, which absorb some of the frequencies. The light frequencies that get absorbed depend on alpha. So if alpha were different in the past, we can detect a change in it by comparing the absorbed frequencies from the past to current frequencies. So what did scientists find? Well, different research groups came to different conclusions. A famous experiment by the John Webb team did observe small variations in alpha, but other research teams who performed similar experiments observed no variation at all. So the evidence is inconclusive. We need more precise measuring devices and perhaps even an entirely new method. That's where this discovery comes in. It's the first step in building something scientists have been trying to build for over 20 years, a nuclear clock, a super accurate measuring device, and our best bet for measuring variations in the constants. Cool, so let's get into what a nuclear clock is and how the scientists made this discovery. I know some of you have been thinking, ""Nuclear clocks? Don't we already have those?"" And the answer is no. We have atomic clocks. They're different, and I'll explain what the difference is. Understanding nuclear clocks will be easier if we first understand atomic clocks anyway, so it works out. But before we get into that, I found out about this nuclear clock breakthrough because I like to keep up with the latest science news, and a news website and app I've been using for a while is today's sponsor, ""Ground News."" What makes ""Ground News"" different is that it's designed to help you pull back the curtain on media bias. For example, recently, a private lunar lander attempted a historic touchdown near the moon's south pole. It was an ambitious mission, but things didn't go exactly as planned. It landed sideways in a crater and was declared dead before completing its full mission. Some outlets framed it as a total failure, while others highlighted the valuable data it managed to collect before shutting down. It's interesting how the same event can be reported in such different ways depending on who's telling the story. That's why I use ""Ground News."" I want an unbiased picture that focuses on the facts. ""Ground News"" is a website and app designed by a former NASA engineer on a mission to give readers an easy, data-driven, objective way to read the news. Every story comes with a visual breakdown of the sources, political bias, reliability, and ownership, all backed by ratings from three independent news monitoring organizations. ""Ground News"" makes it really easy to compare headlines and see how these biases might affect the framing. They even have a bias comparison feature that highlights specific differences in reporting. One of my favorite features is their Blindspot feed, which shows you stories underreported by either side of the political spectrum. For example, if you lean right, you probably miss this story about the US energy secretary emphasizing the need for reliable energy to support the growth of artificial intelligence. As a fellow critical thinker, you know that we can't just rely on one piece of data or a single perspective to get the full picture. ""Ground News"" allows you to analyze news in a scientific way by comparing sources, checking for bias, and building a well-rounded understanding of the most important things going on in the world today. ""Ground News"" are offering you 40% of their Vantage subscription, which is the subscription I'm on. You get unlimited access to all of their amazing features.

Support an independent news platform working to make the media landscape more transparent. Okay, back to the video. To understand what a nuclear clock is, we first need to understand what an atomic clock is. (upbeat music) Today, keeping time is our most precisely measured physical quantity, more than even length or mass, and atomic clocks are our best timekeepers. Their precision made scientists think they're our best bet for detecting changes in fundamental constants like alpha. But how, you ask? The fine-structure constant has nothing to do with time and neither do a bunch of the other constants. Well, to understand, we need to understand what an atomic clock is and how it works. A key ingredient of any clock is a regularly repeating event, like the rotation of the earth, a swing of a pendulum, or the oscillation of a quartz crystal in a watch. This repeating event serves as a reliable tick, but the annoying thing about these clocks is that they can be affected by the environment. Temperature, pressure, and humidity can affect their ticking rate. Their components can break down over time. Even their size and shape can affect how they tick. These problems make these clocks unreliable timekeepers, but atoms have a very reliable way of ticking. From quantum mechanics, we know that the electrons in an atom are restricted to specific energy levels. You can think of them like rungs on a ladder, a wonky, uneven ladder. An electron can jump between any two levels but can't land in between them. The electrons jump by absorbing or emitting light at very specific frequencies. The energies of these light frequencies correspond to the size of the gaps between energy levels, and the higher frequency, the higher the energy. For example, blue light has a higher frequency than red light, so blue light has higher energy. Atomic energy levels are extremely stable, since they're set by the literal laws of nature. They don't change according to pressure or temperature or where they are in the universe. And because the energy levels are so stable, so are the transition frequencies. We can count out a specific number of oscillations of a particular frequency and use those counts as a reliable tick of a clock. For example, the basic unit of time, the second, is defined as the amount of time that passes after 9 billion, 192 million, 631 thousand, 770 oscillations of a certain transition light frequency from a caesium-133 atom. Because of an atomic clock's stability, and the fact that identical atoms under identical conditions are essentially the same, using an atomic clock is more fundamental than a pendulum or a quartz crystal. To put an atomic clock's accuracy into perspective, a cheap quartz wristwatch might drift about 15 seconds in a month, but the most accurate atomic clock in the world, a strontium-87 clock, drifts by only one second in nearly 40 billion years. That's almost three times the age of the universe. Now, here's the cool part. Just as absorption frequencies from quasar light depend on alpha, so do an atom's energy levels. Remember how alpha is the strength of electromagnetism? It therefore influences how close the negatively charged electrons hang around the positively charged nucleus. So if alpha changes with space or time, the electron energy levels in an atom will change too, which will change the transition frequencies. By measuring changes in these transition frequencies, we can measure changes in alpha. Scientists have actually already tried to do this, and once again, there were problems. An experiment performed in 2018 did observe a fractional change in alpha of about one part in 100 quadrillion per year. This result means that if the value of alpha is changing, it's doing so extremely slowly. It would take 100 quadrillion years for its value to double. Okay, but even though they observed alpha's not changing much, it's still changing, right? Well, not exactly. Every measurement has some uncertainty called the error range, which tells us how much the true value might differ from the measured value. When we're measuring everyday objects, small error ranges usually don't matter that much. Who cares if a measurement is off by a quadrillionth of a meter? But when the objects are very, very small, error ranges can become significant. In this case, the error range includes zero, which means it's possible that there's no change in alpha at all. Once again, the evidence neither confirms nor denies a changing value of alpha. About 20 years ago, physicists started thinking about how to use a different part of the atom to make a clock. The nucleus. (upbeat music) Just like an atom's electrons have energy levels, the atom's nucleus has energy levels too, but they're a bit different from the electron's energy levels. Inside the nucleus, there are two major forces at play, the strong nuclear force, which holds the protons and neutrons together tightly, and the electromagnetic force, which threatens to blow the nucleus apart because the positively charged protons repel each other. The balance of these two forces set up energy levels. But wait, why would a nuclear clock be more precise than an atomic clock? Well, even though atomic clocks are vastly better than regular clocks, they still have some problems. They're sensitive to unwanted stray electric and magnetic fields, which shift the clock's energy levels. And although they're much, much less affected by temperature than regular clocks, they're not completely immune. The nucleus, on the other hand, is sealed within the atom, shielded from the outside world by the electron cloud, so it's much less sensitive to unwanted electric and magnetic fields and temperature. Scientists estimate that nuclear clocks could be 10,000 times more sensitive to changes in alpha than atomic clocks. But there's been one major hurdle. Nuclear energy transitions are really, really big. This is because the strong force holds the protons and neutrons together so tightly. Nuclear transitions are usually about 1 million times greater than the transitions of an atom's electrons. They're so large that no modern laser can reach the energies needed to excite them. The technology simply hasn't been invented. Bridging these nuclear energy transitions requires gamma rays, the highest energy light, where no modern laser can go. But in the 1970s, scientists made a strange discovery. By a lucky coincidence, the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces in the thorium-229 nucleus are balanced so that one of its transitions is way smaller than all other nuclear energy gaps, about 10,000 times smaller. This energy lies in the ultraviolet range, placing it within the reach of modern lasers. In 2003, when scientists first started to think about how to build a nuclear clock, thorium-229 was the perfect candidate. Wait, did I just say 2003? If they found out about thorium in the '70s and they've been trying to build a nucleic clock since the early 2000s, and we're in 2025, that's over 20 years. If it's so important, why haven't they built it yet? Well, it turns out exciting a nucleus is really hard. There are a handful of engineering challenges that had to be overcome, spanning across nuclear physics, laser physics, quantum optics, and material science. The main problem was just knowing where to look. People knew the transition was small, but they needed to pinpoint the exact size before they could even begin building a clock. Guessing and adjusting a laser's frequency to match a transition whose size you don't know is like shooting in the dark. It'll take ages. But in 2023, CERN pinpointed the transition's energy. It was about eight electron volts, which corresponds to a wavelength of about 148 nanometers. This discovery set into motion a flurry of three major experiments, all in 2024. In April, a team from Germany and Austria were the first to excite the transition with a laser. In July, scientists at UCLA confirmed the result, improving the CERN frequency precision by a factor of 1,000. And in September, a third experiment made a breakthrough when they measured the transition using a special custom-built ultraviolet laser. The frequency comb laser allowed them to be 1 million times more precise than the previous two experiments. And that's what this is, the long sought-after transition frequency from the thorium nucleus. It's a frequency of 2 trillion, 20 billion, 407 million, 384 thousand, 335 kilohertz, plus or minus two kilohertz. This is an exciting first step towards building the world's first nuclear clock and potentially rewriting the laws of physics.

oONma_591PY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oONma_591PY,think before coming to USA (2024),in 2013 I got admit from five universities I accepted Chico State as my final universities I gave my visa interview I came to United States in 2014 August 5th I landed in San Francisco Airport I came out of the airport and I was living the dream I felt like this is it I made it but soon after reality hit me so hard and the reality is so different than what it is shown on Instagram YouTube and movies and TV shows so I want to share the harsh reality which you are going to face so that way you can be prepared mentally and physically before you come to United States let's go number one is education system it is drastically different in United States versus India that's where I did my bachelor's in engineering special edition if you're from DJ song let me know in the comment section but two significant points which I want to mention number one is assignments practical and hands-on experience you will get in your Masters versus what you did in Bachelor's in bachelor's there's a lot of theoretical knowledge which we get in in India at least in my college but in United States I went to my first semester it was a data structure class we had first week my first week was the bubble sort I think there was a sorting algorithm which was taught to us in the first class and then in that class professor said that you're going to have an assignment that you have to submit by Sunday midnight and then you are going to have a quiz next week in your class so that was shocking to me because we just got your first classroom and we already have a practical assignment which we have to do and so you will be doing a lot more coding especially if you're coming for computer science even if you're coming for Mis or mem or MBA there's going to be Hands-On lots of work versus what you have experienced especially in India and then second part is the grading system in India your final exam does the majority of Grid in United States that's not how it works a lot of professors set up their coursework differently and in some cases final exam don't even matter because all your coursework grading system is divided into like you're gonna get graded on your assignments you're gonna get it on your unit test midterms your attendance your class participation and final exam and sometime in some cases in fact in one of my classes my final exam was only 10 percent of overall grade so I literally did not even give the final exam and yet I got 90 which is a grade in that class yes this is a true story so you cannot be just like I will catch up at the very end you have to work every single day and every single test and every single submission of your assignment you are going to spend a lot of time on Hands-On assignments so that was a drastically different nobody told me that so I'm gonna tell you that so come prepared if you have time if you're watching right now and if you have time before landing in United States whatever your coursework is start reviewing it start figuring out talk to your seniors and start at least practice encoding or whatever you need to do for your assignments hey before we move on to the next part I want to quickly talk about Prodigy Finance this video is not sponsored by them but they have been a great affiliate partner and I want to talk about what do they do if you're someone like me who comes from lower middle class family have no property no asset but still have the dreams of studying abroad in United States you need an education long but no bank will provide you a loan without having an asset or a collateral that's where Prodigy Finance is awesome because they don't judge you based on your financial history instead they make a bet based on your credibility which is awesome and that's why I love them I've been working with them for last five years I highly recommend you to check it out they also even now support education for Australia so go check it out Link in the description and now back to the video number two is roommate issue trust me on this roommates can break or make your Master's Journey I'm not even reading I have seen so many roommate issues where roommates are making the groups and you will feel lonely because everyone is on one side and you're on the other side there's going to be problem in the eating like someone has someone stole your bread or someone stole your milk and there's going to be problem with paying the rent because you are going to share the utilities utilities might be on your name and someone is not paying you the portion of that and you have to nudge them that hey can you pay me can you pay me someone is not going to participate in doing the house tour so you will be responsible for cleaning the apartment and you will feel very frustrated there is so many things that will happen with your roommate so please choose your roommates wisely I highly recommend you that you at least talk to them once or twice and try to figure out if you gel with that person and then make a decision of making them a roommate I was blessed and I was lucky enough that I did not have such issues but I have heard so many stories and trust me what happens is when you get an admit when you get your visa approval you get into this foremost stage is that I am not going to find any roommates and so whatever you get you just say yes and then when you actually start to live with that person who's a stranger you are going to have trouble now don't think that I'm gonna just I can just switch my roommate or I can just move to another apartment it's not that easy in United States you will have to find a sub list which means you have to find another person who can pay your portion of the lease and then you have to do all the paperwork so it's not that easy to just move out of the apartment and get another roommate so you do it you're probably most likely going to be stuck for at least a year or a semester so please please please spend some time in getting a better roommate you are going to face so many things in in your Master's Journey you're gonna do everything on your own uh you're cooking and finances your assignments your coursework finding a non-campus job or internship dealing with immigration you want to come home and have a supportive roommates and you want to be supportive to them and you want them to be supporting in your goals you don't want to have another drama which sucks away your energy and you don't want to be the person where everyone is against you so you just stay in the library because you don't want to deal with your roommate seeing those stories and have heard those stories please spend time in choosing your roommates wisely moving on to the third point which is homesickness and loneliness yes this is the big part everyone poses the photo of people going to Vegas and New York skyline and Manhattan and all of this fancy thing when they do things with their friends or roommates but trust me that's just the half picture they are not showing the photos of them crying and being in the bedroom or working full-time on campus or part-time on campus and and being miserable and feeling so lonely they are missing their parents because they have no one to talk to in India you feel more Community type feeling but even when you land in United States even your roommates and your friends you will feel that they are focused so much on themselves everyone becomes so insecure there will be days when you're applying for jobs and someone will not even tell you that there was an opening on campus they are in cure that you might take away their internship so you might there is the insecurity that you might enroll in the class which they want to enroll in so they might not tell you when it gets open or whatsoever so trust me you will face homesickness and loneliness it is just part of this journey where you will feel that especially if you are coming from a big family you've never lived with strangers and never moved out of your house this is going to be hard for you so come mentally prepare that this is going to be hard for you and if it doesn't happen then great I would be more than happy to take that hit that Duty said that it was going to be so hard I'm happy to take that head if you find it easy but if you come with a mentally that oh it's gonna be easy and if it is hard you are going to face that problem I know so many people who thinks that everything is going fine but still find homesickness and find loneliness they have friends but yet they feel lonely they are going out but yet they feel lonely so please understand that you'll feel that mentally a little discourage so come prepared for that the white homesickness and loneliness I would highly recommend you to step out of your comfort zone especially if you are introvert this is going to be a little harder than extroverts extroverts are much easier they can just go and talk to people but or introverts like me you just have to make a little bit extra effort you have to find people for similar interests join clubs and groups on campus fine other roommates find other people in your community who you gel with and talk to them and make a genuine effort to talk to them have a constant relationship with your parents and friends and maybe to call them frequently so that way you don't feel so much homesickness and loneliness and if you still do I'm always available please DM me on Instagram I would love to talk to you and just understand what you're going through and me help you with anything you need number four is on-campus jobs a lot of time people come with this understanding that on-campus jobs are gonna be like given to them there's there's no such reason for you to believe this yeah people think that it's gonna be easy and people think that oh it's gonna be just given to me and there's result so many on-campus job I'm just going to get it or some people come with an assumption that they're going to get the ARA greater jobs no it's very very very competitive yeah you might get like cafeteria jobs and if you want to do that so don't come with that assumption that it's going to be easy start applying for jobs before you land in United States yes that's the trick start reaching out to your seniors start reading out to your professors before you come to United States that brings me to the point of financial plan like a lot of time finances like you have to manage your finances if you've never managed it so that is now new thing you will have to learn but a lot of time people come with a plan that oh cost of living is going to be covered through my job and my you know semester fees will get covered through my internship so they don't plan for it and they only plan for the first year they don't plan for the second year or they don't plan for their living cost no please don't come with that understanding please come prepared financially that you will have some form of financial plan if something goes wrong maybe you got sick not healthy you cannot work on campus maybe your grades are dropping and you need to focus on that maybe you need time to focus on your internship and full-time search so that's why you can't work on campus and because of that you need money to pay for your living costs don't come with this assumption that everything is just going to be like glamorous and given to you it is going to be hard moving on to the next one which is internships and full-time jobs this is going to be the hardest part of your Master's Journey not even education not even submitting assignments and not even dealing with roommates finding internships and full-time job is going to be the most hardest thing you've ever done because you're gonna face so many rejections is it even all worth it yes it is going to be worth it once you finish the race but for now you just have to keep going I recently went to Arizona State universities I met with 100 plus students all of them told me they don't have internship or at least they don't have any interviews most of them don't even have seniors who are graduating they don't have full-time jobs lined up obviously this is the time it's 2023 if you're watching it in later years then 2023 was the worst year for the tech company because there's a lot of layoffs happening so this is the worst time for them and you know it's hard for them they are not able to find internships they are waking up with rejection they are not even getting interviews so they in spite of them doing every single thing right they might not have a full-time job when they graduate and they have to use some or the other mechanism to stop their 90 days clock and all of that so please come prepared that you might face this situation you might wake up every single day with a rejection email that you didn't get an intention so please come prepared not just mentally to not get an internship but also prepare yourself so that you can get internship I've made several videos on how to get internship how to get full-time job how to break into tech industry with zero experience please watch them because they are for you so that way you can understand all of how it works and so please prepare from day one from the day you land in fact I would say even before you land in United States let's talk about next one which is hard work physical health mental health emotional health is going to take a big toll meaning you are going to be physically exhausted you are not going to have a car all the campuses are very very big so you will have to walk everywhere and you would be counting and I do Uber you most likely cannot because it's going to cost a lot of money so you'll be walking all around your campus even if you want to go from your house to campus it's just going to be a lot of walking so physically you will be exhausted especially you you're not going to pay attention to your physical health because you focus so much on on campus job and getting an internship finishing your assignment studying for your coursework and all of that and networking and so on and on so you think that all of that is more important than your physical health and you will not focus on physical health I highly recommend you don't make that mistake I've made that mistake myself please focus on your physical health because if you your health is good the best all things will follow mental and emotional health mentally you're gonna face so many rejections you're gonna talk to your seniors there's gonna be people who don't like you there's gonna be in your batch made there's going to be groupism will happen some people will not like you some people will not want to talk to you that's okay you are you move on and you don't you're not there to impress them there are going to be seniors and alumni and people on LinkedIn who you will try to reach out so that you can network with them you can build relationship with them yes there will be people who won't respond to you there will be people who will reject your connection request who might not refer you because of XYZ reason so come mentally prepare with all kinds of rejections you are going to face so that way when you land here if things go well it's great but if it doesn't go well at least you came mentally prepared for it there are going to be days where you're going to doubt your decision there are going to be days where you feel like you want to cry cried out it's all good there are going to be days where you're going to miss your parents you're going to miss your friends and you'll feel alone but it's all good you got this all in all I just wanted to show you the reality what all things you will face and not just that fancy trip which you will take in New York or Dallas or Vegas or California I want you to come prepared for all the things which people are not showing you which they are going through they are not showing you the rejection email they got it they're not showing that they're crying in the bedroom because they feel lonely they are not showing the dishes and toilets they are cleaning because that's not something they want to flaunt yes you will be doing all these things so I want to show you the reality and come prepared mentally so that way when this happens you're ready to face them if you like this video I'm pretty sure you're going to like this video which is about how to get an internship and things to do before coming to United States and also this one which is also mentally preparation before coming to United States I'll see you guys in the next one until then keep smiling and keep us thinking you gotta hustle every single

AZN4DrVYWPU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZN4DrVYWPU,7 Ways To Make Money With AI In 2025! 🤑,"Everyone's talking about AI and everyone's promising that it's going to replace jobs, change the industry, and rewrite the world. But what no one is telling you is how you can earn from this wave that's coming on. Not in theory, not in VC funding, but exactly you sitting at home and how you can make money, maybe with nothing but a laptop and some time. In this video, I'm not going to give you any recycled ideas like build your own AI chatbot or build your own AI SAS. That's not helpful. Instead, I'm going to share seven different groundbreaking ways to make money in 2025 with AI. These are strategies where I've seen people make money with no code, no VC funding, no fancy degree, just purely using the AI tools that are already available to you. So, let's begin. Let's start with the one that almost everyone misunderstands. AI content strategy. Not AI content creation, but strategy. Right now, thousands and thousands of small brands, consultants, creators are trying to create content on LinkedIn, on Instagram, and basically every social media platform. They're even trying to start their own blogs, emails, and newsletters. And let's just say they're not doing it at their best potential. And that's your opportunity if you can use tools like ChatGpt and Gemini to not only ideulate, outline, and draft your entire content, but also to give it structure and your own voice. add in some clips and pacing. Well, then you're not just a writer. You actually become the brain behind their entire content. Their online presence is now dependent on you. And it's not just going to be a one-time gig. If your personal touch is actually good, well, then your clients are going to want you back week after week and basically want you to just think about their brand 24/7. In 2025, content doesn't just need to be created. It actually needs to be directed as well. And AI can give you the ingredients, but you you're going to be the chef behind all of this. Now, once the content is created, what happens next? People of course need to find it, which is why AI powered SEO and backlink outreach is so much more important than ever before. The old school model of digital PR where you're essentially paying thousands and thousands of dollars just to get a mention, that's basically dying now. Instead, what's working is intelligent AIdriven outreach. You need to find websites that are linking your client's competitors and then use Chat GBT or Gemini to create a hyperpersonalized message to these clients. You basically now need to explain why your client's content or product is much more updated than their competitors. You want to explain how it's relevant, how it's useful, and why it works. This strategy really works because AI is basically helping you research, write, and outreach to clients. What used to take hours is now just going to take minutes. And if you can deliver even 10 highquality backlinks to your client every month, that's thousands of dollars of perceived value for basically work that almost cost you nothing. This is a gold mine. Design is also going through a similar transformation. And I'm not talking about graphic designers. I'm talking about becoming an AI design strategist. Because here's the thing, businesses are using tools like Canva and Midjourney to create their content, but they don't have enough time to generate the prompts and actually experiment with the content they're creating. So, if they're trying to experiment with different thumbnails, they're probably just generating one of them and not five of them to test out which one works the best. And you can be the one that actually does this. And not just because you know how to use the tool, but rather because you know what actually works and of course what looks good. You know how to look at conversions. You're going to be the person that gets someone to actually stop scrolling. Whether it's YouTube thumbnails or Instagram reels or LinkedIn posts, it's not about creating AI content, but more so the engineering behind getting the users's attention. You'd be surprised at how many creators are actually spending thousands and thousands of dollars behind this exact strategy. Next up is something that is so simple yet so critical. AI powered website builders. Every new business needs a site, but most business owners still don't know where to start, and that's where you come in. You can use tools like Lovable or Bolt to create the actual website. Use tools like chat GPT and Gemini to actually create the code or the prompts that you're going to be using for these other tools. And then use tools like Canva or Midjourney to create the graphics that are going to go on this website. And within 2 to 3 days, you'll have fully functioning website. And with this, you didn't even have to touch a single line of code. You're not a developer, but you're someone that knows how to use the AI tools correctly. Offer this website as a flat package rate, maybe $500, $1,000, and the clients will be more than happy to pay this to you. And you can even charge more if you actually add SEO or page setups and login for the clients. The most valuable real estate in 2025 isn't physical, it's digital, and you basically just became the architect. Now, let's go a little deeper. Let's talk about building AI agents for businesses. not building new AI, but rather just setting up the AI agents that already exist and using the AI tools that are available to you. Right now, tools like Zapier, Make.com, NAN provide you a noode, visually appealing platform for you to create these AI agents. You can create very smart workflows, autoresponses, and chat bots for these businesses. something that will probably take you at max a single day. But businesses don't even know where to start with this. Now, remember that these businesses are not just looking for simple answers like, ""Hi, how can I help you?"" They want agents that actually qualifies leads and actually is able to answer complex questions. They should be able to remember previous customer interactions as well. And trust me, if you've mastered building these agents out correctly, businesses will genuinely genuinely pay for this. and they'll pay so much money because it really saves them time, closes their deals, and actually feels futuristic to the clients they're serving. Again, you don't need to be technical. You just need to know what the problem is exactly and then use the tools available to you to connect them all together. Still with me? Let's shift gears into something that is so important, education. It is now one of the most in demand sectors because of AI. Parents and students are desperate for personalized learning, but one-on-one tutoring sessions are absolutely expensive and generalized courses are well just too generic and doesn't really have a great conversion or completion rate. This is where you come in to become the learning architect. Using AI, you can create hyperpersonalized tutoring programs as well as smart courses. You can use chat GPT to design a custom curriculum for the student that you're serving. Use AI voice or AI video tools to create a very engagement curriculum and then set up AI powered quizzes that adapts to the students answers. You're not just providing information here, but you're actually tailoring an entire package, an entire curriculum that is going to be super super helpful for the students. Package this for high ticket clients like universities, colleges, and different schools. Or you can just sell this as an entire package like a curriculum or course. And you can do this at scale because you can use AI to create content and actually sell these courses. Now you're not just a teacher, but you're the future of education. Now for the most powerful one, the AI automation agency. This is where you step out of the freelancer mindset and into the business mindset. Companies today are drowning in tools. They've got CRM, email marketing platforms, Slacks, messages, and so many other tools that are all well disconnected. If you walk in and then understand their workflow and then say something like, ""What if I can set up a system where the user just simply sends their emails, fills out a form, and then they automatically get added to the CRM, get added to your backend, and then is able to get an introductory video without you doing anything. These businesses will listen and they will pay you and they will also refer you. You're not offering a service, you're rather offering clarity."" And in 2025, parody is very rare. And if you pick out one specific vertical such as fitness coaches, agency owners, or course creators, and then go deep into this workflow, understand it, and then build out these systems, you're going to be in a very, very good position. You will truly stand out into the market. So, what should you do now? Don't try to do all seven. Pick something that you're actually good at or something that fits your current set of skills. If you're good at writing, start with content creation or YouTube. If you're good with visuals, then maybe designing website is up your alley. And if you're analytical or system focused, well, then creating agents and creating workflows is what you need to do. Don't overthink all this. Just start. Run an audit, do one free project, and get results. And then package this outcome, and then pitch it to three other people. AI isn't here to replace you. It's here to partner with you, but only if you know how to use the correct tools and how to move along with it. You need to start building today. So, stop waiting for the perfect idea.

1X8sN-DIlbw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X8sN-DIlbw,Project Stargate Explained & How You Can Remain Relevant in the AI Era,Donald Trump just approved project Stargate and it's probably one of the biggest news that you're going to hear in this era together these World leading technology Giants are announcing the formation of Stargate Stargate Stargate Stargate Stargate it's set to change the future of AI and Tech in ways we probably can't even imagine yet and it's not just a big deal for those in Tech but also society as a whole so let's break it down so on January 21st 2025 Donald Trump approved project Stargate which is a collaboration between soft Bank Oracle open Ai and mgx this project aims to invest up to $500 billion in developing The Cutting Edge AI infrastructure in the United States the first $100 billion is an immediate investment and is already building massive data centers and the first ones are already built in Texas the goal of this project is obviously to make sure that America is the leader of AI and also to create thousands of new jobs and simulate the economy growth while it's being marketed as benefiting the entire world there's actually some nuances of who actually benefits from these Technologies more on that later first let's talk about the key players of project Stargate so first we have soft bank which is run by masayoshi Sun open AI which is going to drive the AI Innovation and it's led by Sam Alman Oracle which is run by Larry Ellison and is going to be bringing the expertise in cloud computing and then we have Nvidia and arm which is going to be focused on the hardware side so they're going to be providing the chips and the gpus required for these AI models and finally we have Microsoft which is a strategic partner that open AI has already partnered with and they actually run most of their systems on the Microsoft azour this project really highlights the AI armor race that's currently unfolding it's kind of similar to the Cold War era that we were in but now with digital Tech countries like the US and China are really fighting to see who dominates the AI industry whoever gets to AGI first is probably going to control the trajectory of Technology now AGI refers to artificial general intelligence basically means that it can do everything that a human can do and better Sam Alman described this project as one of the most important projects of this era emphasizing the fact that it's going to revolutionize so many Industries like healthc care Logistics education and so much more Larry Ellison even spoke about how AI is going to change the health care industry and be able to detect cancer very early on create personalized vaccines and so much more early cancer detection the development of a cancer vaccine for the for your particular cancer aimed at you and have have that vaccine available in 48 hours this is the promise of AI and the promise of the future while there's obviously a lot to be excited about project Stargate also brings up some concerns the first one obviously being data privacy and surveillance Larry Ellison's vision of using AI for constant surveillance has obviously sparked a lot of debate his comments about AI analyzing realtime camera data and monitor people's behavior is obviously very concerning and next we have geopolitical implications although this project is marketed as beneficiary to humanity there's obviously some implications of keeping AI out of certain countries which means that it's going to increase the global inequalities that we already have and then another concern is obviously corporate influence with companies like Oracle Nvidia Microsoft open AI there's obviously skepticism about whether this project is really for the Public's benefit or just for the corporate benefits but regardless of all of these concerns AI is coming to us as lightning speed whether we like it or not so it's super critical for you to adapt and prepare and in my opinion there are three areas that you should focus on first one is artificial intelligence and machine learning obviously you really want to learn how AI works and gain hands-on experience on building these models AI is really going to power the next wave of innovation so learning the basics is just going to open so many doors for you in this career path and if you're just beginning to get your hands dirty in AI then I want you to create a full stack application and incorporate the AI API into this application to make it smarter the next topic that I think is going to be relevant is cyber security there's going to be so much data that's going to be flowing through these infrastructures so protecting that data is super vital AI systems are only as secure as the environment in which they run on and finally the next field that I think is going to be super relevant is cloud computing Stargate infrastructure is going to heavily rely on cloud computing systems like Azure and Oracle so getting a certification in this area from AWS Google Cloud Microsoft Azure is going to just put you at a very valuable spot in this future the advancements being made through project Stargate really has the potential to solve problems that humans have just never seen before and so you need to start learning how to use AI it's not even a question anymore if you want to stay up toate on the latest Ai and the latest tech make sure to like this video And subscribe to this channel see you in the next one,MID,SIGNAL,ai_career_strategy,future_of_work,3,3,3,"Explains a large AI initiative and ties it to how

uB9yZenVLzg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB9yZenVLzg,This video will change your mind about the AI hype,it seems like it's just a 1% Improvement this is actually a 10x Improvement to go there's a new virus running around have you heard about it it's called hype it's as old as human history and some of the symptoms include rabidly mentioning the term ai ai first generative AI third aiying AI finally rigorously tested AI with AI and making verifiably false claims Google's best Gemini demo was faked that's their headline I want to try to address some of your anxieties but at the same time I'm not an expert I'm not following every Cutting Edge research paper but I would argue two things sometimes when people spend all their time focusing on every tiny little detail it prevents them from zooming out and looking at the bigger picture and also most of the conclusions I'm going to make in this video are actually in line with the leading AI researcher at meta and many other intelligent folks who do happen to be experts so perhaps they is some truth to what I'm about to say now I can't predict the future I can't tell you exactly where the tech job market is going but I'll try to provide some historical context give a lot of facts and to reach my conclusions I'll make a series of thought experiments some of the things on my list to address are fake demos why is every big company investing in AI it must means something right a lot about human behavior actually and also with so many unknowns in a changing world how do us humans make big life decisions like which college major to pursue or which career path to transition into pretty much everything I'll talk about today centers around one thing technology changes a lot but there's one thing throughout all of human history that doesn't change and that's human nature obviously all of this started in 2022 when Chach PT was released at that point I think two things were immediately clear to anyone who is paying attention one this is a revolutionary technology completely unlike the web 3 hype two this technology was going to be slow moving it wasn't going to change the world overnight and I publicly made these claims the day after GPT 4 was released make no mistake this technology will revolutionize the world it's already doing that but I don't think it's quite as powerful as the hype is making it out to be I even question questioned Sam Alman and open ai's ethics and do you know what people said to me they said I was coping they even said I was a Google fan boy I don't know where they got that idea but more recently people are starting to agree with me it's been revealed that open AI has made employees sign illegal non-disclosure agreements they're promoting a culture of lying what data was used to train Sora we used publicly available data and licensed data so videos on YouTube I'm actually not sure about that and this weird thing where Sam Alman is scanning people's eyes in exchange for some useless cryptocurrency For Better or For Worse I've been pretty good at avoiding this sort of herd mentality so honestly it didn't really bother me when people said I was wrong now who knows all of my predictions could turn out to be wrong everything could change overnight but I'm going to explain why that's unlikely these big tech companies can't all be stupid why would they be pouring billions of dollars into Ai and chips firstly I agree they're not stupid but that definitely doesn't mean they haven't been wrong before and second the question of why is kind of hard to answer so let's do a thought experiment to answer the question let me ask you a question if you were Google what would you do you have the choice of invest in AI or skip it in the case of investing it's possible that one it pays off AI hype was actually well worth it the second case is that Google loses money they lose their investment it wasn't worthwhile believe it or not from Google's perspective either of these two outcomes doesn't matter because if the investment pays off Google will make a lot of money if it doesn't pay off Google will make a lot of money the last thing Google would want is to skip the investment and then somebody else entirely disrupts Google's business Google is a monopoly they have so much money they don't know what to do with it and they sure as hell aren't going to give it to their employees so the case that every company is trying to avoid right now is the case of Microsoft in the late 2000s Steve let me ask you about uh the iPhone and the zoom if if I may $500 fully subsidized with a plan I said that is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn't appeal to business customers because it doesn't have a keyboard which makes it not a very good email machine now with hindsight are there things I'd do differently of course like what come on charie I probably would have started as doing Hardware earlier so that we could have been more effective in the phone business I mean this is kind of like an IQ test Microsoft missed out on smartphones and missed out on a trillion dollar industry that is the case that Google and every big tech company is trying to avoid Maybe these investments will pay off eventually but right now the only company that's actually making money from AI is NVIDIA they're the ones making the profit it's not surprising because they're the ones selling the shovels it's not proven yet that those shovels can actually find gold and it might never be proven history repeats itself this has all happened before in different ways please tell me you don't have amnesia please tell me you didn't forget the Euphoria of 2021 when every company was just hiring as much as they possibly could why do you think they did it because we're in a new world we will need as many Engineers technology is everything now and if we don't hire a bunch of people our competitors will and then we'll fall behind and what happened after that not just Google not just Amazon not just meta not just Microsoft all these big tech companies were dead wrong and they laid off thousands of people you have to understand that hype is a force of nature it's the most powerful marketing tool that's ever existed let's talk Devon AI for a second I made a video talking about it right after the announcement I thought the founders were super smart but also that I'm not worried about Devon because these people are clearly fighting an uphill battle I don't know a lot about it the benchmarks say that this is more effective at software engineering tasks than the other llms I wonder if that's because it just puts a few things together like it has its own capabilities to like do research like go on Google browse stack Overflow and run code and execute code and they just put those pieces together more more cohesively than GPT obviously in a short amount of time they didn't create their own complex llm I'm pretty sure they're using one of the existing llms I didn't closely examine the evidence or anything like that it seemed kind of obvious to me a few months later people people are realizing they were fooled by the hype Devon is extremely overrated at least for now if you don't believe me maybe you'll believe this guy he basically proved that at this point Devon AI is more useless than a freshman CS student who's one week into their first programming course more recently they've kind of pulled back their claims okay for now we're just going to start with some code migrations here and maybe some code refactoring over here now can you think of another company who heavily exaggerated their claims and still turned out to be pretty successful well I can think of a few dozen but the most notable example would probably be Tesla I've patiently been waiting for the day that I can just sit in a car and have it drive me somewhere Tesla has been selling full self-driving software for a long time and I'll say this gently but I think I have very different definitions of full self-driving but it doesn't matter does it people buy the hype it's not going to be long long before Tesla cars actually are a good investment your Tesla will appreciate in value you'll be able to use it as a robo taxi when you're not driving it again it's not true but it probably worked in raising the hype for Tesla it's less likely that Devon will replace software engineers and more likely that it'll make the founders and investors a lot of money and there are many times where people blurred the lines between hype and fraud notably examples include thonos and FTX very recently there's been a bunch of fake demos the Sora video was fake it was created largely by a video Studio the Google Gemini demo was fake so why did companies do this because it works Devon AI is valued at $2 billion that's a lot for something that's currently just an open AI rapper especially when open AI itself is valued at $80 billion but to go back to answer the question of why build the hype let's think about it from a numerical standpoint if I have a company that's valued at $2 billion that's incredibly valuable because if I need to hire somebody I'll give them a salary and all also just throw in hey why not 100K in equity in my company you can't sell it yet it's just paper money for now but hey bro it's 100K don't pay attention to the fact fact that my company is not profitable now and it might never be my company is worth 2 billion this especially applies to startups and non-public companies but it also obviously applies to publicly traded companies short-term stock gains are good for them because they can then issue shares at a higher valuation it's basic math now when it comes to the rate of improvement of these llms throwing better chips at them will help throwing better highquality data at them will help and definitely another research breakthrough like the transformer architecture will also help but it could also be possible that computers are just incompatible for the level of intelligence that many people are expecting them to have isn't it possible that a paradigm shift might be necessary who knows what it could be it could be quantum computers or it could be some kind of organic material so here's how I think about this it's impossible to predict what the rate of improvement of AI is going to be but we do have a few data points already it's been almost 2 years since chat GPT was released and quite frankly from GPT 3.5 to GPT 40 the rate of improvement has obviously been very slow now who knows when GPT 5 releases it could be a dramatic Improvement just like how GPT 3.5 was and of course the bigger question isn't what's going to happen in 2 years it's what's going to happen in 10 or 20 years is the rate of improvement going to look like this or is it going to look like this well we obviously don't know but if you're good at anything you know that as you get better and better it becomes harder and harder to improve this is analogous to so many things an example I think is really interesting is distributed systems if you have a system with 99% availability and now you you want to push that system to 99.9% availability it seems like it's just a 1% Improvement how hard could it be but that's a very common misconception it's not a 1% Improvement this is actually a 10x Improvement to go from 99 to 99.9 because the failure rate with a a system that's up 99% of the time is just 1% of the time with this system would be 0.1% there's 10 times fewer failures and of course we know with AI when it works people are fine like they're impressed but when it fails that really matters when it comes to Tesla if your car fails even one time it could be game over this needs to go down as small as possible so in fact we're not trying to go to 99.9% but I want it to see it I want my Tesla to go as far as it could possibly go it'll never be a 100 even humans aren't that good but I think it's becoming clear that the rate of improvement eventually is going to dramatically slow down it's just not quite clear what the bottleneck is just yet I have so many examples I could share with you I'll share a couple very quickly one Tesla faked a self-driving demo in 2016 why would they do such a thing companies want you to think that they're better than they are they're improving more quickly than they are because if you buy at the bottom well eventually it's going to be up here and even if it never gets there well you already bought the product if I was a taxi driver and I quit my job over something Tesla or Elon Musk said I would feel kind of like a jackass fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me so when Elon says we're going to have artificial general intelligence within 2 years I'm a little hesitant and I'm more inclined to listen to The Experts it's not like Elon makes claims purely from an emotional perspective it's I'm sure he's always driven by facts and logic and research I have a relatively simple way of making tough decisions given so many unknown variables and the first thing is it's not proven right now that software developer jobs are being automated who knows that could change overnight and even if it were to start happening it still wouldn't be proven and that we don't know if like the code quality will suffer so much and there will be so many outages that it wasn't worth it it wasn't worth saving a little bit of money in the first place and second is more of a human aspect how can you live with regret if you were to drop out of your major right now or transition into a completely different career because you're predicting developers will be automated within a few years and it turns out that that doesn't happen happen can you live with that how would that make you feel obviously consider the alternative you change paths right now and you get a step ahead well what exactly are you getting a step ahead on I don't know what exactly you're planning on doing becoming an accountant a lawyer a physician because if developers get automated which jobs aren't going to be automated there is some aspect of at least we're all in this together I would not make any drastic decisions especially when it comes to education guys guys we have calculators why are we still teaching kids math we have voice to text engines now nobody needs to know how to read and write I'm sure all the cuttingedge researchers right now have very poor math skills and very poor reading and writing skills the logic that goes into programming can be applied in so many areas especially business that's why some of the best Business Leaders today are technical Founders honest to God I think I owe most of my success in the education I received early in my life teaching me math physics and eventually programming now of course some things are really complex like architectural details but some things are simple it's obvious that human brains are fundamentally different than the most advanced AI today humans only need at most a couple dozen hours to fully learn how to drive medium medium Li well at least most of us small children only need to see and an animal a few times like a cat to be able to identify it in the future this is just not true with AI today and I'm also saying that AI is going to make some improvements it's going to automate many things it's not in my opinion going to live up to this dramatic hype that we've seen but it doesn't need to live up to the hype to make some people a lot of money if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch you must first invent the universe thank you very much,MID,SIGNAL,ai_hype_critique,ai_trends,3,3,3,Critically examines AI hype and encourages more measured expectations with

2V7yPrxJ8Ck,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V7yPrxJ8Ck,The LeetCode Fallacy,just improve your problem solving skills and you'll be able to pass all your coding interviews just solve some linkless questions over here and some tree questions over there and then you'll be able to derive the edit distance algorithm yourself just like this Soviet mathematician did in the 1960s if that sounds ridiculous to you it's because it is let me tell you a little secret you're not supposed to figure it out yourself did you ever watch that episode of Naruto where the exam is intentionally designed to be so difficult that the only way to pass is to cheat well that's the modern coding interview in a nutshell let me tell you what I mean we all learned long multiplication as kids we all memorized this algorithm to get the product of these two numbers First We Take 2 * 5 that's 10 the one is carried then we do 2 * 5 over here that's 10 again we remember we carried the one so it's actually 11 we start all over with the three on the second row but before we have the zero over here and then we say 3 * 5 that's 15 then we say 3 * 5 once again that's 15 so this becomes 16 take these two add them together we get 1760 now I know what you're thinking this is just math how is it relevant to leak code but please just hear me out most people don't care enough to ask why does this work they don't care enough to notice that this is the same as writing it out like this but this is a hard problem so let's make it easier this is really just 5 + 50 this is really just 2 + 30 expanding it out taking two times this part we get this taking 30 times this part we get this and this part over here you can notice is going to be 10 + 100 this part over here I'm actually going to rewrite it I'm going to make it even more simple why not 30 that's too big I'd rather have 10 * 3 and then multiply that by 5 + 50 so now just focusing on this part over here this is going to be equal to 15 + 150 and so this becomes 110 which look it looks pretty familiar over here this becomes 165 which looks to me like we had that over here and now it becomes clear why we add a zero over here doesn't it it becomes pretty clear cuz we just take the 10 out of the 30 over here this isn't really three times these numbers we just took a shortcut to make it simple for us and then at the end We'll add that 10 so just like now I'm going to add 10 I'm going to add a zero here this is 1650 and now this is just addition I took multiplication and and turned it into an addition problem this is called problem solving and now that I've gone through this I have at least a chance of discovering long division on my own have you noticed that some people are naturally better at leak code or just learn faster than others well usually those people come from another highly technical background like math and they probably already built a lot problem solving skills that can be applied to computer science it makes sense why a mathematician would have an advantage over say a farmer for example so what can you do to give yourself an advantage don't focus on extremes if you try to memorize solutions for every single problem which is not easy by the way you'll never be able to solve a new problem if you never look at the solution solution for a problem you'll spend 10 hours on a single problem and still won't be able to figure it out in my opinion there is an intersection between memorizing and problem solving you need a little bit of both if you're going to memorize anything please please memorize the DFS algorithm it's the single most important algorithm in coding interviews memorize the core CS algorithms like binary search the sliding window technique and when you get super familiar with these core skills you realize that most leak code problems are just about identifying which core algorithm to use and then applying it to the specific problem in other words in terms of coding interviews problem solving is all about pattern recognition a reasonable approach to interviews would be to First learn the core algorithms needed it's fine to look at Solutions you're in the learning phase just like an ml model you're taking in training data after that you should try to apply your knowledge if you were able to derive the solution to all these problems by yourself it would greatly improve your problem solving skills but that's obviously not realistic but consider this if you're trying to figure out the edit distance algorithm you would have a much better chance of doing so if you first solved the longest common subsequence problem because it has significant overlap and of course that's not something you realize until you've actually solved these problems which is kind of why I've organized them in this list you don't have to have already solved the problems to make that connection by the way this is n code. there's a ton of free resources on it so check it out if you want to

8wysIxzqgPI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wysIxzqgPI,My Brain after 569 Leetcode Problems,"I've solved a lot of leak code problems. Hey guys, I'm still unemployed, so let's solve another leak code problem. And eventually got an offer from Google where I've interviewed over a dozen candidates. After hundreds of hours of grinding and explaining problems, I learned there are different levels of preparation. And I'll share everything I know about the process, including how to practice, how many problems you should solve, common mistakes to avoid, and whether I think leak code is a total waste of time. Like most people, I started with easy questions. I used C++ because it was the first language I learned. But this was a bit of a mistake and unfortunately I didn't learn so until later on. Initially, I wasn't even able to solve the easy problems. Even if I knew the solution, I would always get tripped up by edge cases. I wasn't an expert in data structures and algorithms. I mainly knew the basics like arrays, linked lists, hashmaps, trees, sorting, and binary search. And honestly, I think that's pretty much enough before you actually start solving problems because a lot of the easy problems will solidify your understanding of the basics. And 50 problems later, that's where I was. I could solve a lot of the trivial problems like reversing a string or inverting a binary tree. But I hadn't even touched a graph problem. And I didn't even know what dynamic programming was. But believe it or not, 50 problems was enough for me to get an internship at a bank. But I knew I had to keep grinding if I wanted to get a job at a big tech company. So, I continued to solve problems in a random order, which was another mistake. But probably 60 or 70 questions in, I switched to Python. I would always look at the leak code discuss section, and I saw that Python code was always the shortest and most concise. Even though I had never used Python before, and still to this day, I've never used Python at any job or internship. It was an easy choice to make because you don't have to learn the entire language. You really just have to learn the basic syntax, how to write if statements, for loops, and all the standard data structures and methods. And you can actually learn these as you solve leak code problems just by googling as needed. Now, C++ isn't a bad choice either, but I would definitely avoid a verbose language like Java. The language probably won't be a dealbreaker, but it can definitely save you a few minutes when you're typing out your code, which can definitely make a difference in a real interview. But it doesn't matter how fast you type if you can't actually solve the problem. And even after solving a 100 problems, while I had learned all the high-v value algorithms like DFS, BFS, sliding window, and backtracking, I wasn't able to consistently solve a new problem for the first time. I didn't know it then, but the reason was that a lot of leak code questions are sequential. You've probably seen questions like house robber 1, house robber 2, and house robber 3. Obviously, you should solve these questions in order, but actually most of leak code questions should be solved in a specific order. For example, you should never try solving dynamic programming problems unless you already have a solid understanding of backtracking. And you probably shouldn't try solving graph problems until you have a solid understanding of trees. This is obvious in hindsight, but I'm sure a lot of people make this mistake, which is why I created a road map so that you don't make the same mistake I did. It turns out that the order you solve problems in does matter. I also think that solving one or two problems a day consistently is a lot better than cramming because the ideas will actually stick. If you need a little motivation, I've been solving daily leak code problems on my second channel. As I continued, I realized that if I couldn't solve a question in 45 to 60 minutes, I wasn't going to be able to solve it myself. Previously, I would literally bang my head against the wall for 3 to 4 hours on a single problem because I thought that was the only way to learn. But let's just be honest, most of us are not going to be able to come up with some of these complex academic algorithms by ourselves. And even if you can come up with Floyd's tortoise and hair algorithm, it's probably not an efficient use of your time. There's no shame in looking at a solution as long as you can understand exactly why it works. That's why in my videos, I really try to explain my thought process behind every problem. This ended up saving me a lot of time because I would get to a really hard problem, a crackhead problem. I like to call them like burst balloons and I would get pretty close to solving the problem. I would know it's a dynamic programming problem but I just couldn't figure out the trick behind it. Then I would look at a solution and only after 5 minutes of reading I would realize, oh that's the trick and then I would be able to immediately solve the problem. I was able to go from 100 to 250 solved questions a lot faster than I was able to solve my first 100 questions. And by then I had learned 99% of the patterns that I needed. even some of the complex ones. And I got to the point that writing out these algorithms like DFS, BFS, and binary search was as easy for me as writing a for loop. Even some advanced ones like unionf find, dickstras, I could write out in less than 5 minutes. And that's when I realized that most leak code problems fall into these buckets. For medium questions, you just need to figure out what algorithm you need and then apply it. Hard questions are similar, except there's usually a really complex trick behind them. And sometimes, unless you've seen it before, only God can help you figure it out. Or maybe your interviewer if they happen to be generous. At this point, I was confident I could pass interviews, but I wasn't 100% sure if I was ready for the big tech interviews like Google or Facebook. And spoiler alert, you will probably never feel 100% prepared. It's not a binary decision whether you are ready for an interview or not because you never know which questions you're going to be asked. It's more of a distribution. You might have a 50% chance of passing or you might get to the point where you have a 90% chance of passing. If you're a perfectionist, I'm sure you want 100% chance, but that's almost never going to be the case. I think a good rule of thumb is that you should be able to solve a medium problem that you've never seen before in 20 to 25 minutes. If you can do that, you probably have at least an 80% chance of passing most Fang interviews. And I continued to solve up to 569 problems, even though I had already gotten into Google, mostly because I'm a loser. But it's not quite as timeconuming as you might think because I've gotten to the point that I can solve most medium questions in 10 to 15 minutes. But I definitely don't recommend it because there are diminishing returns on solving more and more problems. I think quality is much better than quantity. I recommend solving about 150 questions like the neat code 150 list which has video solutions and code solutions in 14 languages. But make sure you really understand each and every problem. A huge mistake that most people make is that they don't go back and review previous problems. For these complex algorithms to really sink in, you need repetition. That's why I'm working on taking each problem from the Neat Code 150 list and converting it into a multiplechoice quiz because it's really hard to go back and resolve each question. And usually all you need to do is review the trick. So, I made quizzes that you should be able to solve in a few minutes, but also get a lot of value from it. You can check out a handful of problems right now, but when the list is complete, ideally you should be able to go through it in just a single day. I think this will be a huge timesaver for people. So after all that, is leak code just a big waste of time? Yes, if you're trying to learn about development and actually building applications, leak code probably isn't going to help you do that. But people will spend thousands of hours getting a CS degree to get a decent paying job, but won't spend an extra 100 hours to get a big compensation bump. It doesn't really make sense to me. Don't get me wrong, leak code isn't the most exciting thing in the world, but I do think it helps you think about edge cases and how you would unit test your code. These are skills that can be applied to application development. And believe it or not, algorithms and data structures are widely used in industry from database engines to compilers, but it's true that leak code won't teach you everything.

VUVpTZVa7Ls,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUVpTZVa7Ls,Count Vowels Permutation - Dynamic Programming - Leetcode 1220 - Python,hey everyone welcome back and let's write some more neat code today it's been a while so hopefully we're not Rusty let's solve count vowels permutation by the way if you're not aware I've added a bunch of cool updates to NE code. and I'm continuously updating it so check it out if you haven't and please feel free to leave me any feedback or improvements that you'd like we're given an integer n and our task is to count how many strings of length n can be formed under the following rules we're basically allowed to construct strings only using these five characters but for each character there's a rule any a character can only be followed by an e character any e character can only be followed by either an A or an i and any eye cannot be followed by another ey basically that means it can be followed by any other character except for I so any of the other four characters O's can only be followed by eyes or you and use can be only followed by A's and of course in this example we're given a pretty trivial case where n is one in that case we can only create strings of one length so each individual character can satisfy that immediately let's start with the Brute Force case let's start uh for Nal 2 what would that look like well initially we have five choices the string can start with an A E I O U now we have five strings one of them ends with an a one ends with an E another ends with an i o u so going on this path how many strings of length two can we create well remember A's can only be followed by E so the only choice we have here is to put an e what about for this path e can only be followed by A's or eyes so we actually have two choices here we can put an a here or an I so we can end up getting two string like this eyes can be followed by every character except for I so here we'll actually have four paths which are going to be a e o u for o we'll have two paths I and U that's what we're told over here and U's can only be followed by A's so here we'll have that path so we can see for strings of length 2 we can create 3 + 4 + 3 so that's about 10 and we could continue down this decision tree but you can tell that this might not be super efficient we're doing this the very Brute Force way and if you did continue this decision tree you would notice some repeated work but it's a little bit unusual so we're going down the dynamic programming track but it's going to be slightly different let me show you why so here the string is ending with the character a the most important thing about all these strings is what is the last character because that's what determines what the next character can be we already know that for A's the only character that can follow is an e so we know for this one there's going to be an e for this a there's also going to be an e for this a there's also going to be an e so one thing that's going to be helpful for us is to map the last character to the count of how many strings end with that last character so for a we want to know how many strings do we have that end with a when we were at n equals two when we were talking about strings of length to we had clearly three strings that ended with an a we want to store that information for every single character we have so for every of these five characters good thing we have a constant number so that's going to be important for time complexity reasons but this is five it's a constant we don't really care about con constants so back to the idea of mapping to the last character we'll have something that looks like this so for each character will have a row and the columns are going to represent what's the length of the string so for length one how many strings will we have ending with an a we'll have just one string how many ending with an E we'll have one we'll have one for each of these but for length two we know it gets a bit more interesting how many strings do we have ending with an a well we counted that we had three of them so we can put a three over here but what's a good way to calculate this without necessarily going through every single Branch every single possibility is there a formula we could use to calculate this well we can and we just need a tiny bit of reverse thinking instead of thinking what goes at the end of a string that has a we already know that A's can only be followed by e but that's going to give us strings that can end with an E we want strings that can end with an A so let's look at for every other character which one of these characters can be followed by an a can e be followed by an a yes they can can I's be followed by an a they can be followed by everything except an I so yes they can be followed by A's can O's be followed by A's no they can't they can only be followed by eyes or 's can 's be followed by A's yes they can so ease eyes and 's can be followed by an A so to get the value here what value is going to go here what we can say is get the number of strings ending with an E the number of strings ending with an i and the number of strings ending with a u add them together and then we can get this the value that goes in this position so to summarize this is what the math formula for calculating what would go in this this position and this is the case for the second column so we have a two here and then ones in the other positions because we're looking at the previous column but this could be generalized for this to be n and this to be n minus one and that's assuming that this two-dimensional grid we have is called DP because yes this is a dynamic programming problem and if we can create a formula for calculating how many strings end with an a we can use this a similar logic to do that for every single character uh that we have here and I'll show you the exact formulas in the coding explanation I'll just quickly mention the case for the character o because it's interesting because o can't go at the end of a u it can't go at the end of an a it can't go at the end of an e it can only go at the end of an I so when we're calculating how many strings can end with an O we're just going to take whatever value happens to be at I and then you know copy that over here because O's can only go at the end of strings ending with an i so in general the way we're going to calculate the result we're going to have some formula here right it's going to take a few of these values add them and then put them here and then the same thing could be said about each of these right so each of these calculations happens in O of one time so doing all five calculations let's say just takes o of five time it's still a constant to do that but how many times are we going to have to do that well whatever the N happens to be if n is one or two it could could be a variable amount it could be you know some big number but the point is it's a variable so we're going to keep going until we get to n so the overall time complexity since each of these phases is constant time doing it n times is going to be o of n time complexity the space complexity is also Big O of n because yes we have five rows but five is a constant we don't care about that and actually if you notice to calculate the values in one column we only need the previous column anyway so actually the memory complexity could be condensed to be Big O of one so that's the idea now let's code it up okay so now let's code it up and in the interest of time you can see I've already coded it up but I am going to walk you through what this is so first we have our DP our two-dimensional grid we know that it's going to be accessed something like this where J is going to be the length of the string so it's not going to be I in this case so that's the length of the string we're looking at and the second one is going to be the character the last character of the string so you can see I have an empty list added because how many strings of length zero can we create well I'm just not going to consider that but this is all the strings of length one I've mapped each of the vowels to an index so a maps to the zeroth index e maps to the first index etc etc for each of the characters we have just a single string of length one now in the problem statement they say that the number could end end up being really big so we have our mod constant defined and as we compute the number of permutations we're going to be modding it by this constant so now we're going to start looping we're going to start at JAL 2 and keep going until we reach n and J remember represents the length of the string so initially what I'm doing here is just a pending an array of five dummy values I'm just initializing them to be zero so this is where we're going to put the number of strings of length two that end with an a are going to go in this spot that end with an E are going to go in this spot here I here o and here youu and at this point I'm just doing the math formulas I'll briefly explain each of these so to get the number of strings ending with an a of length two let's say J is two in this case we just get the number of strings of length one J minus one that end with an E added with the ones that end with an I added with the ones that end with a u because the character a can go after any of these three characters so we add them together and assign it here and of course we mod it because we don't want the number to be bigger than the mod e can go after the character a or it can go after the character I so that's how we're doing this here I can go after the character e or it can go after the character o o can only go after the character I so we're not even adding anything to it so we're not even having to mod here and actually looks like I forgot to mod down here so we do need to mod here because we're adding a couple values but here we don't need to mod because we're assuming that any value stored in our DP grid has already been modded and then the same logic could be applied to this formula as well and then once we've computed all of those all we know is in DP of n we have some list like this so DP of n happens to be an array which tells us how many end with an a end with an E end with an i o and u if we add all of those together we get the total number of strings of length n that we have and then after summing those we can mod it in Python we never overflow so I am allowed to do this but maybe if you're using Java or C++ or something you would have to Loop through adding two adjacent values together and then modding them instead of adding them all up at once but now let me run the code to make sure that it works and as you can see on the left yes it does and it's pretty efficient so I really hope that this was helpful if it was please like And subscribe if you're looking to practice more check out NE code. it's got a ton of

q5ANAl8Z458,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5ANAl8Z458,132 Pattern - Leetcode 456 - Python,"Hey everyone, welcome back and let's write some more neat code today. So today, let's solve the problem 132 pattern. We're given an array of n integers and we want to find a 132 pattern such that there are three integers and they appear in the order I, J, K. So J appears after I in the array and K appears after J in the array. But the order of the values actually is going to be a bit different. Even though K appears third in the order, the value of K is actually going to be strictly in between I and in between J. So that's why it's called the 132 pattern because the second value that appears is actually going to be larger than both the left value and the right value. So taking a look at an example, how could we possibly solve this problem? Well, we know that we have to have at least three integers. First of all, we can look at the first value. We can look at the second value. And since we've looked at at least two values, now we can start looking for our target value, which is going to be the K. Because we know K is going to be the third value that appears after I and J. And what we want from K is to find a value that is less than a previous value. That's our J value. We want K to be less than the J value. But we also want K to be greater than the I value. And we also want the J value to be greater than the I value. Now that's pretty complicated. Even doing this in a brute force way would not be simple. we would say that okay this is possibly our k. So now we want to start looking backwards to find a value that is greater than this value four. We would look at one that's not greater. We would look at three that's not greater. So we didn't find any value. We did not find our j candidate. So now we continue. We will now go to the fourth value. We're going to consider that this is our k value. Let's start looking backwards for our J candidate. Let's look at the previous value first. This is a four that is greater than two. So we found our J candidate. Now we want to find a value that is now we need to find a value that is less than four but is also less than K. And if the value is less than K, then we know for sure it's going to be less than J. So now we need to find a value that's less than two. We look at the previous value. it's one and that is less than two. So that pretty much means that we found our i, we found all three values that we needed. So in the worst case, this kind of pseudo brute force solution that I showed, every time we get to a value, we'd potentially have to look through every previous value that came before. But there's a way to optimize this problem using a stack data structure. Let me explain it to you because it's definitely counterintuitive, at least for me. Remember how when we get to a k value, we want to then look backwards in reverse order to see if there's any values greater than this value. For us to do that efficiently, it would be nice if our stack was always in decreasing order, also called monotonically decreasing order or monereasing order for short. And this is actually a somewhat common stack technique. So, it's not like I'm just making this up, but if you've never done it before, I would not expect you to be able to come up with this by yourself. Even if you know what this is, it's not super easy to apply it to this problem. I think this problem is deceptively difficult. The best way to show you how this is going to work is with an example. So, we're going to iterate through the array. First, we're going to look at three. We would want to check normally, are there any values greater than three before it, but we know there's nothing before it because our stack is empty. So, we're going to go ahead and add three to the stack. We're going to look at the next value, one. And in this case, we're also going to ask, are there greater values before? There's a three, which is good, but there's only one value. We need there to be at least two values that came before because this is our K candidate. So, in this case, it's not going to work either. But let's just continue to go through this example. We're going to get one, and then we're going to get to four. But did you notice that for this one, it was easy for us to know that there were greater values that came before it because our stack is in decreasing order. When we get to the one, every value on the stack before it was greater than it. But now when we get to the four, all the values before it on the stack are smaller than four. So they're practically useless for the purpose of four. So what we're going to do is pop them. So we look at one at the top of our stack is less than four, we pop it. three. The top of our stack is less than four. We pop it. But now we are going to go ahead and add four to the stack. By the way, for four, we found that even though now there are at least two elements that came before, none of them were greater than four. So four is definitely not our k value. Now we get to the last value two. We want to check the top of our stack. Is the top of our stack greater than two? Yes, it is. It's four. But there's only one value now on our stack. What good was it for us to have removed the other values? Cuz now how do we know if we have a solution or not? Well, there's one thing that I haven't mentioned yet, and it's that on our stack with every single value, we're also going to be maintaining what was the minimum value that came before that end value. Because notice how we're trying to get this inequality right as we go through uh position by position. We are searching for a k value, right? The top of our stack is potentially a j value. That's why we want to maximize the top of our stack. It could be the j value. But what about the i value? Well, we want to minimize the i value. The easiest way to do that is every time we add a max value to our stack, we also take what was the minimum value in the entire array that came before that value. This is really easy to get for us because we can actually maintain the minimum in a single variable. And you know as we added three, three didn't really have a minimum value. Or we could say that you know the minimum value before that was three itself. For one, the minimum value before one was also three. For four, the minimum value before four was one. So even though yes, we did remove some values from our stack, we didn't lose any important information because what what we really want to keep on the stack are the maximum values. It's okay if we removed some smaller values because we are still keeping track of the minimum. And it's okay that we removed smaller values also because every time we get to a new value in our array to give us the most number of options for the k value, we always want the top of our stack to be the maximum. That'll give us the most flexibility when it comes to finding a k value. And so by the time we reach the end of the array, if we find a solution, we can return true. If we don't, we can return false. In the worst case, we'll end up adding every single value to the stack at most once and then popping it from the stack at most once. So that'll be, you know, 2* N operations. That's going to reduce to big O of N. That's the overall time complexity. That's also going to be the overall memory complexity because of our stack. So now let's code it up. Okay, so now let's code it up. Like I said, we're going to have a stack data structure. This is actually going to contain a pair of values. is if you don't want to have a pair of values on this, you can just have two different stacks which will probably be the exact same size. One will contain the number and one will contain uh whatever the minimum value to the left of that value is. And by the way, this is going to be monotonically uh decreasing. Uh it's a little bit counterintuitive, but if we have the stack in decreasing order, that will make it easier for us to find the maximum. the maximum isn't necessarily always going to be on the top of the stack. Actually, we might have to pop some values to get to the maximum. So, let's uh continue coding it up. Uh, by the way, we're also going to be maintaining the current minimum value. Initially, we're just going to say that's going to be the first value in the array, but you could also set it to like float of negative infinity or something like that. We're going to iterate through every value in the array. But we can actually skip the first value. And we're skipping the first value because that can't possibly be the k value anyway. It can't be the j value either. It can only be the i value which uh is going to be on the minimum of our stack anyway because it's already we're already putting that first value in current minimum. So if it's going to be relevant, it'll be relevant through that. But the first thing we want to do when we look at n is check if there are any smaller values than it on our stack. Then we are going to pop them. So while our stack is non empty and n is greater than or equal to any values on the top of our stack we're going to pop them. You're going to see why I'm doing greater than or equal in just a second. Because after we've done this, after we've popped every value that's greater than or equal to it, then there are two possibilities. Either our stack is empty or our stack is non- empty. And in that case, then we can check if n is actually smaller than the top of our stack. With this, we're basically checking that there is a value that came before n that's greater than it. And we also then want to check and is n greater than the minimum value that came before this value. What is the minimum value that came before this value? Well, conveniently we stored it here in the second index. So I'm just going to copy paste this. And instead of putting zero here, I'm going to put one here. So if this is the case, that means we did find our 132 pair or 132 pattern. And then we can go ahead and return true. Now one thing you might notice though is since we did this while loop while n is greater than or equal to that continue popping. Then in our if conditional why do we even have to check if n is smaller than the top of our stack? We know by definition either the stack is empty now and if it's not empty then for sure this is going to be smaller than the top of our stack or else our while loop up here would not have even executed. So actually you can get rid of this if you want to. But if we did not just find our solution, well then we're going to go ahead and append to the stack this uh first of all a pair n is going to be the first value and then the current minimum the minimum value before n is also going to go. We know that we're maintaining our decreasing order in the stack because we popped all elements that were greater than it or equal to it. Uh, and we also don't want to forget to actually update the current minimum after. So, we're going to take the minimum of itself and the current value n that we're looking at right now. So, after that, if we never find the solution, we're going to want to return false outside of our loop. Now, let's run it to make sure that it works. And as you can see on the left, yes, it does. And it's pretty efficient. Sometimes it's inconsistent on leak code, but who cares? I really hope that this was helpful. If it was, please like and subscribe. It really supports the channel a lot.

xo7XrRVxH8Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo7XrRVxH8Y,8 patterns to solve 80% Leetcode problems,I have solved 554 lead code problems but you don't have to it took me 500 plus problems to realize that there is an easier way to become better at coding problems and that is just focus on the patterns that repeat over and over again in this video I'll show you eight such patterns let's start with sliding window pattern the sliding window pattern is used when you need to process a series of data elements like a list or string in the sliding window pattern you find specific things in a list by looking at a smaller part of the list at a time the part of the list that you are looking at is called your window this window then slides one step at a time until the entire list is scanned when do we use the sliding window pattern if a problem asks you to find a subset of elements that satisfies a given condition think about sliding window pattern your input would be a linear data structure like an array string or a link list and you would have to find the longest or a shortest substring or subarray that satisfies a particular condition for example look at this longest substring with K unique characters problem your input is a string and you need to find the longest substring that satisfies unique characters condition it's a classic sliding window problem next we have the subset pattern the subset pattern is used when you need to find all the possible combinations of elements from a given set repetitions may or may not be allowed depending on the problem in the subset pattern we need to explore all the possible Arrangements of elements from the given set take for example this permutations problem from lead code to solve this problem you can iteratively build all the subsets level by level start with an empty set at each level consider all the ways to add the next element to the existing subset and create create a new one this approach is very similar to breath first search or BFS next we have the modified binary search pattern the core idea of binary search is to divide the search space in half again and again in the modified binary search pattern the core idea Remains the Same but we need to adjust the logic a little bit to solve the given problem let's take the example of search and rotated sorted array problem here the array is sorted but rotated at an unknown Pivot Point you'll need to modify the standard binary search to figure out which half of the array to search in one thing that helped me a lot to solve modified binary search problems is understanding the core binary search algorithm really well for the core binary search algorithm you need to be able to visualize where left and right pointer end up if the array contains duplicates or if the array does not contain the target let me give you a good way to improve your visualization of binary search bisect module in Python contains two functions bisect left and bisect right Implement these two functions in the language of your choice and your understanding of binary search will improve a lot before we talk about the next pattern I want to make it very clear that you need to have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms to solve the problems that we are discussing today if you want to know how to master DSA and how much DSA you need to learn before you can solve these problems you can join my free 5-day email crash course on interview.io moving on the next pattern we have is topk elements pattern the topk elements pattern is used to select K elements from a larger data set given a particular condition think about this pattern whenever the problem asks you to find top ranking elements from a data set the input would usually be a linear data structure like like an array or a list for example given an array of numbers you need to find the kth largest number efficiently to solve this problem you need to keep track of the K most important numbers that you have seen so far since you care about the kth largest element the largest K elements you have seen so far are most important so you would store them using a data structure called Heap we'll come back to why we use a heap in a moment anyway the smallest number on the Heap would be the K largest number we have seen so far if the new number is larger than the K largest number so far you will remove the K largest number so far and add the new number to the Heap we use a heap here because it makes finding and removing the smallest number very efficient next we have depth for search of a binary tree or binary tree DFS pattern binary tree DFS helps you visit every node on the tree focusing on one branch at a time generally you would use recursion to do this here is how the flow looks like you will start at the root node after that you apply DFS recursively to the left node this process continues going deeper and deeper into the left subtree until it reaches a node with no children once the DFS reaches a dead end on the left side it backtracks now it focuses on the right node if it exists and applies TFS recursively Again by doing this you explore the entire right subtree for example in this very popular problem called maximum depth of binary tree you need to find the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node for this you simply keep track of the depth as you do a binary treat DFS and whenever you reach a dead end you update the maximum depth if the current depth is more than the maximum depth it's that simple next pattern we have on the list is topological sort the topological sort is used to arrange elements in a specific order when they have dependencies on each other it's particularly useful for directed a cyclic graphs whenever the nodes of a graph have one-way connection between them and there is no cycle it's called a directed a cyclic graph think of topological sort whenever you have a prerequisite chain let me explain what I mean by this imagine that you're building a complex program some parts of the code might rely on some other modules being written and tested and these modules can in turn depend on some other modules topological sort can help you figure out the order in which you should write your modules by analyzing the dependencies between different modules it creates a sequence where each module is processed only after all its prerequisites have been completed try this course schedule problem on lead code where instead of modules we have courses as prerequisites for other courses next we have breath for search of binary tree or binary tree BFS pattern so we already covered binary tree DF BS in binary tree DFS we go deep into a branch and explore it completely then we move on to the other branches in binary tree BFS we take a different approach BFS explores all the nodes at same level in different branches first to do this you'll need to use Q data structure in the beginning the queue would only contain the root node after that you're going to repeat the process I'm going to show you again and again you'll remove a node from the front of the queue and do any operation that you might want to do with it then you add both its children on the Queue you keep keep doing this until the queue is empty by doing this the elements at the same level of the tree will always remain next to each other on the Queue this way you can process them one after the other a problem that is a direct application of this pattern is called level ordit reversal of a binary tree it's exactly the same what I just explained lastly we have the two-pointer pattern the two-pointer pattern is used to solve problems when you need to iterate through a sorted array taking a hint from the name itself we'll be using two pointers in this pattern each pointer will keep track of an index in the array by moving these pointers smartly we can often solve the problem in a single pass making the algorithm more efficient let's take the example of the two sum problem you're given a sorted array and you need to return the index of two numbers that add up to a Target sum to solve this problem you can use two pointers the first pointer starts at the beginning and the second one starts at the end of the array depending on whether the sum of the numbers at the pointers is less than or greater than the target sum you will either move the left pointer to the right or the right pointer to the left this works because the input array is sorted another variation of the same problem is when you need to find triplets that add up to zero in a sorted array so far we only covered some popular lead code patterns but your job is not done yet you need to find some problems that fall in each of these patterns and solve them one by one but before you do that learn how to master data structures and algorithms by signing up for my free email crash course on interview.io my name is sahil and I'll see you in the next

xauCQpnbNAM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xauCQpnbNAM,Russell's Paradox - A Ripple in the Foundations of Mathematics,"- Hi, everybody, Jade here. Today's video is about one of the most famous paradoxes in mathematical history. It's called Russell's paradox named after Bertrand Russell, super cool dude, very influential philosopher/ mathematician/ logistician/ social activist/ Nobel prize winner, so yeah, we'll get to know all about him but this is probably one of my favorite paradoxes and it's really one of those ones that just makes you really question everything, you know, question everything you know. So yeah, I'm super excited for this video. Just before we get into it, I just wanna say that this is probably the most genuinest video I've ever done. There's a lot of subtleties and there's a lot of philosophy. So if you find that you're getting a bit lost or you need to like rewind or watch the video again, that's totally normal and I'd actually be pretty surprised if you've got everything the first time. So yeah, let's get right into it. So first, I'm going to introduce you to a somewhat simpler version of the paradox, just to soften some of the concepts that we're going to talk about later on. So, this one is called the Barber paradox and it goes like this. There is a town with one barber and his task is to shave all and only those who do not shave themselves. Now, the question is, does the barber shave himself? Think about it, if the barber does not shave himself, then he should and if he does shave himself, then he shouldn't. So? So, keep this little riddle at the back of your mind throughout the rest of the video but now, let's get right into the math. So Russell's paradox is ultimately about the foundation of mathematics, but some of you might be unfamiliar with that concept, what is a foundation of mathematics? Well, let's draw an analogy with the other sciences. The sciences are kind of like a tree. Biology is the study of living organisms, which are the result of millions and millions of chemical interactions. So, one could conclude that all branches of biology stem from chemistry or that chemistry is in some way, foundational to biology. Likewise, chemical reactions are ultimately physical interactions. So, one could conclude that all branches of chemistry stem from physics. If we keep going down in this way, we'll eventually come to the elementary particles that make up our universe, electrons and quarks. The laws that govern these particles can be considered the foundations of science in that, the rest of the sciences stem from them. If we were to discover something completely new about them, it would somewhat affect our understanding of the other sciences, even if only at the theoretical level. In the 19th century, each branch of math was pretty disconnected from the other branches and there was no unifying trunk. Mathematicians at the time wanted to unify the branches of mathematics and therefore, a foundational theory was needed. But what made it tricky is that, the approach to figure out the foundations of math is very different to that of the other sciences. We learn about the other sciences by observing the outside world, whether it be watching cells under a microscope, measuring orbits through a telescope or smashing particles together at insanely high speeds. But we can't really learn more about mathematics by observing the outside world. Math seems to be something that just is. We can imagine a universe where the fundamental building blocks are different or where time goes backwards, or where everything was made of anti-matter, but we can't really imagine a universe where two plus two equals five. Math is different in that it seems to be true by definition and even though it's very good at describing our universe, it doesn't seem to be about our universe. Why? That is the question at the heart of this paradox. Now, it's here that we steer away from the harder sciences and head more toward the study of what reality really is, philosophy. We come to the first character in our story. The question, why is math the way it is, captured one of the greatest philosophical minds of all time, Plato. Plato thought that mathematical objects, numbers, shapes and the relationships between them were objective truths, that is, objects that existed independently of us and our world. He thought they existed in their own world, which he called the World of Forms. But one of Plato's pupils, Aristotle, had his own views. Unlike Plato, he thought that numbers themselves weren't objects but properties of objects. For example, if there were four cows in a field, it wasn't that cows were an object and four was also an object, but the number four was a property of the collection of cows. He also thought they didn't exist in their own World of Forms, independent of our world but they described features of our world and so, belonged to our world. Another colorful philosopher, Immanuel Kant, soon came along and he didn't like the view that mathematical objects were objective truths and believed that to understand the basic principles of math, you needed some kind of intuition. That yes, math described our world, but we also brought it to the world from our experience. Now, this is where our quiet hero of the story comes along, Gottlob Frege. Yes, interestingly, Bertrand Russell is not the main player in Russell's paradox but a German mathematician named Frege. The story of Frege is somewhat tragic as he was largely ignored during his life and 20 years of his life's work was unjustly washed down the drain. But here, he will be remembered as a God among us. Frege disagreed with Aristotle's view that numbers were properties of objects because of this argument. If numbers are properties of object, then one number should belong to any object and it shouldn't be influenced by matter of opinion but then, imagine a pair of shoes, is it one pair of shoes or is it two shoes? Depending on how we conceptualize an object, the number belonging to it changes. Again, imagine a deck of cards, depending on how we conceptualize it, it could be one deck of cards or 52 cards. So Frege concluded that numbers don't apply to objects, but to concepts. He also disagreed with Kant that to understand math, you needed intuition and experience, stating that the laws of arithmetic can be known from the basis of reason alone. ""I sought to make it plausible that arithmetic is a branch of logic and need not borrow any ground of proof whatever, from either experience or intuition."" Frege's main goal was to reduce mathematics to logic and show that logic is in fact, the foundation of math. This idea is known as logicism. Now, the notion of logic that Frege had in mind is pretty similar to how we would use it in everyday language, but just to make it super clear, logic is a tool for reasoning about how different statements affect each other through nothing more than deduction and inference. For example, if we take it as a fact that old dogs have a good sense of smell and Tifa is a dog, deductive reasoning will tell you that Tifa has a good sense of smell. I don't know if this is the best example though because she's pretty old, I don't know if she can smell much anymore but you get the idea. Frege started his quest of reducing math to logic by coming up with a definition of what number was. Now, this might seem like a somewhat trivial question to some of you, what is a number, but remember at the heart of Frege's paradox was the idea that you don't need any kind of intuition or experience to understand mathematics and when you think about it, have you ever actually tried to describe what a number is without using the word number or words derived from the word number? I've spent some time trying as I was writing this video and I found that I always ended up using the word number again, or a word that was directly related to number, like amount or quantity. Give it a go right now and let me know what you come up with in the comments. Frege defined numbers by using this idea of concepts and extensions. A concept is pretty much any idea you can think of, the color red, shape, Bill and Bob, Shakespeare's plays, hipsters, elephants with no ears, literally any idea and an extension is the set of all things that fall under that concept. For the concept the color red, its extension would be the set of all red things past, present, and future. The concept Bill and Bob would be made of the extension of the Bill and Bob you were referring to. If we have a concept like square circles, which doesn't make sense, their extension would simply be the empty set, a set with nothing in it. Numbers, Frege stated, are extensions of concepts. For example, the number four is the extension of the concept of all things made up of a collection of this many objects. The number seven is the extension of the concept of all things made up of a collection of this many objects. Frefe built his foundation of mathematics from the axiom that all concepts we can possibly think of have a corresponding extension and therefore, there are as many extensions as there are concepts. He named this the General Comprehension Principle and it sounds reasonable, right? Can you think of a concept that doesn't have a corresponding set to go with it? I don't think I could, but Bertrand Russell did. Frege was just about to have his work printed when he received a letter from Bertrand Russell in June, 1901 which read along the lines of, ""Dear colleague, I find myself in complete agreement with you in all essentials. In regard to many particular questions, I find in your work discussion, distinctions and definitions that one seeks in vain in the works of other logisticians. There's just one point where I have encountered a difficulty. Consider the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. Is that set a member of itself?"" This simple question shattered Frege's foundation and caused him a mental breakdown so severe, he ended up in hospital and later, caused him to write, ""My efforts to throw light on the question surrounding the word number seems to have ended in complete failure."" Let's break it down. First, a word about sets. Sets are a collection of things. You can even have sets within sets. Take, for example, the set of all sets of bird species. There exists a set of all penguins, the set of all seagulls, the set of all pigeons and the set of all other bird species and they themselves would make up the set of all sets of bird species. Most sets are not members of themselves, that is, they don't fall under themselves. For example, the set of all teapots is not a teapot, the set of all turtles is not a turtle but what about the set of all things that are not turtles? Because it's a set and not a turtle, it is a member of the set of all things that are not turtles. Therefore, the set of all things that are not turtles is a member of itself. A lot of sets are members of themselves and there's nothing too extraordinary about that. But the question that Russell asked was, is the set of all sets that are not members of themselves a member of itself? Think about it, if it is a member of itself, then it is not and if it's not a member of itself, it is. Sound familiar? I'll say it again, if it is a member of itself, then it's not and if it's not a member of itself, it is. Now the reason that this was so catastrophic is because the last thing you want in a neat systematized axiomatized description of anything is a contradiction. Imagine if one of the foundational laws of physics predicted that gravity both always pulls and always pushes. It would be a pretty useless law. When your system is able to derive two opposite theorems, this puts into question the entire theory. Numerous attempts were made to correct this hiccup, like Russell's Theory of Types, which tried to put sets into some kind of hierarchy but many thought that this fix was too artificial and ad hoc. Frege eventually felt forced to abandon many of his views about logic and math. Even so, as Russell points out, Frege met the news of the paradox with remarkable fortitude. ""As I think about acts of integrity and grace, I realize that there is nothing in my knowledge to compare with Frege's dedication to truth. His entire life's work was on the verge of completion. Much of his work had been ignored to the benefit of men infinitely less capable. His second volume was about to be published and upon finding that his fundamental assumption was an error, he responded with intellectual pleasure, clearly submerging any feelings of personal disappointment. It was almost superhuman and a telling indication of that of which men are capable if their dedication is to creative work and knowledge instead of cruder efforts to dominate and be known."" Apparently, he didn't know about the breakdown. Anyway, after a series of fortunate events, the foundations of mathematics is now known to be a system called Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory, which has a lot of Frege's original ideas incorporated into it. But although this is currently the most widely accepted theory, the search still isn't over with candidates like category theory and homotopy type theory becoming serious contenders for that much desired position at the bottom of the math tree. But that is for another video. (upbeat electronic music)",HIGH,SIGNAL,math_foundations,mathematics,2,4,4,"Explains Russell's paradox with historical and conceptual clarity, low fluff.",
2MCt3AxCL6I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MCt3AxCL6I,The Dark Sky Paradox - A Never-Ending Universe,"- This episode was made possible by Curiosity Stream. Hello, welcome to Up and Atom, I'm Jade. When you look at the night sky, what do you see? Twinkling stars, maybe some planets, but mostly darkness. Why? There are an estimated 100 to 400 billion stars just in our galaxy, and an estimated 100 to 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe. Any patch of sky you choose to look at should contain thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of stars. So, where are they? Why can't you see them? I always thought they were just too far away to see with the naked eye, until I heard this argument. Imagine a universe that spreads out infinitely in all directions with stars spread uniformly throughout. Now imagine a gigantic cosmic onion with earth at its center. Look at the stars contained in the first layer. They're very close to earth, so we have no problem seeing them. However, there aren't that many, so the overall brightness isn't too high. All right, let's move to the next layer. These stars are further away, so the light coming from them is not as intense as the first layer. But wait there more stars making the brightness higher than the first layer. When we do the math, we find that the decreased brightness due to the distance of the stars and the increased brightness due to the extra number of stars exactly cancel out. Therefore, the second layer should be just as bright as the first. As we keep going through the layers, it's the same story. As each layer gets further from earth, the stars get dimmer, but as the layers get bigger in size the more stars are contained within them. Viewed from earth our onion of stars might look something like this as we add layer upon layer. If we assume infinite layers or at least a lot, the night sky should be completely lit up. So then why is it dark at night? This is the dark night sky paradox, otherwise known as Olbers' Paradox, and it took over 500 years to solve. In this video we're going to talk about the fascinating tale of its solution and how it led to one of the most profound truths we've ever discovered about our universe. This problem captured the attention of one of the most famous astronomers in history, Johannes Kepler. He came to the same conclusion we just did, arguing that the whole celestial vault would be as luminous as the sun. In the onion argument we assumed that the universe was infinite, that it extends forever in all directions, but this was a pretty big assumption. Kepler thought that may be the reason the sky is dark at night is because the universe isn't infinite, but actually kind of small. Perhaps there weren't that many layers of stars and beyond them there existed dark outer wall enclosing the universe, that would explain the darkness that we see. Meanwhile, the astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, that guy who this paradox is named after, offered a different solution. Olbers argued that space is filled with interstellar dust and gas that blocked the light from more distant stars. But let's think this through, what happens when you make something really, really hot? Eventually it glows. Now you need extremely hot temperatures for this to happen, but the universe seemed to have been around for a decently long time. Often millions of years, light shining at gas clouds would heat them up to extreme temperatures, definitely hot enough to stop glowing. Eventually they'd shine with the same brightness as the stars they blocked. Honestly, Olbers' theory doesn't contribute a lot to our story. I just felt like he needed a mention as the paradox is named after him. So we're back to Kepler's idea of a small, static finite universe with not that many stars. But something is missing from this universe, something pretty important. Can you guess what? I'll give you a hint, it's what's keeping you stuck to the earth right now. That's right, gravity. The gravitational attraction between all the planets and stars would cause them to be pulled together and eventually to collapse in on themselves. Even if this hadn't happened yet, our universe would appear to be shrinking. So here was the current conundrum. If the universe was infinite, the night sky should be bright at night. If the universe was finite, the pool of gravity should be causing it to collapse in on itself. Or if the universe was finite, there had to be something wrong with the current theory of gravity. So, which was it? You know what would be handy right about now, a telescope. At the time, the telescopes weren't that powerful and it was thought that the tiny smudges of light seen through them would just nebulae within our own galaxy, until Edwin Hubble came along with a much more powerful telescope. He could see that these smudges were actually galaxies beyond our Milky Way. If a bunch of galaxies are moving toward us, this would be a pretty good clue that the universe is collapsing, that we do live in a finite static universe, just like Kepler said. So what did Hubble find? Well, I don't know how to tell you this, but they were moving away from us. In fact, the further away the galaxy, the faster it was moving away. The universe appear to be not falling in on itself, not remaining static but expanding. As you can imagine, this was quite a surprise. Why was the universe expanding? And if it was expanding, then further back in time it must have been smaller, right? All the galaxies, stars, and planets would have been pretty squished and even further back, all matter would have been densely packed together. What could have set all of this matter in motion? Well what about some kind of giant explosion, some kind of big bang. This is now what cosmologists believe happened and it is the famous big bang theory. They think it happened about 14 billion years ago and was the birth of our universe. Okay, that's great and all, but still, why is it dark at night? Well, there are two very important consequences that follow from an expanding universe. The first is this. Here I am dripping drops of water into my bath. Every time a drop hits the water, it creates a wave. I'm trying to drop the drips with a fairly consistent frequency so that the wave length, the distance between the crests of each wave, stays roughly the same. You've probably seen something like this before and it's not really that interesting. However, things do become interesting if I move my hand. I'm dropping the drips with the exact same frequency as before, but because my hand is moving the trailing wavelengths are longer and the in front wavelengths, I don't know, these guys are all bunched up. Same frequency but because the wave source, my hand, is moving the wavelength change. This is called the Doppler effect. This is the same effect that happens when an ambulance passes you by, the sound waves are stretched out and sound lower. Similarly, this is exactly what happens with light coming from distant stars. As you may know, light is a wave, as stars move away from us they're light waves get stretched out. Humans can only see certain wavelengths of light and when the wavelengths get too long we can no longer see them. This is called red shift, as red has the longest wavelength of all the visible colors. For very distant objects the light waves get stretched so much that they become infrared and we can no longer see them. So in a sense, the night sky is lit up, we just can't see it because of our limited human eyeballs. So that's one reason. The second is in my opinion quite romantic. Light moves at the very fast speed of about 300,000 kilometers per second. It can travel around the earth seven and a half times in one second. This is the cosmic speed limit. It's pretty fast, yes, but actually it's not that fast when we consider how big our universe is. The Andromeda galaxy is the most distant thing we can see with the naked eye, and it is 2.5 million light years away. That means it takes 2.5 million years for light to travel from Andromeda to us. When you look up at it, you're seeing it as it was 2.5 million years ago. It's true that nothing can faster than the speed of light, except nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. The space in between things, the nothingness, can stretch or expand faster than the speed of light. In science talk, this is called the space-time expansion and it's the only thing that can travel faster than the speed of light. So what does this mean? Because of the finite speed of light and the fact that the universe has a finite age of about 14 billion years old, we can only see stars and galaxies whose light has had enough time to travel to us. The expansion of space-time complicates things even more. In the far out regions of space where space is expanding faster than the speed of light, the light from those galaxies will never outrun the expansion. No matter what we do or how long we wait, we'll never be able to see light from those galaxies. It will never light up our skies. What we see in the night sky is just a tiny fraction of the whole cosmos. We call this the visible universe and we cannot even with the most powerful telescopes see beyond this horizon. It isn't just a horizon in space, it's a horizon in time. Beyond the edge of our visible universe, the light will never outrun the expansion. just like walking too slowly on an escalator going the wrong way. So why is the sky dark at night? It's not because the sun goes down or because the stars are too faint, and we still don't know if the universe is finite or infinite. It's dark at night because of the expansion of space time. When you look up at the dark sky, you're looking at evidence of the beginning of our universe. But how did it all happen? How did something come from nothing? How did the big bang unfold? Well, there's a scientifically accurate computer simulation called the illustric program, and it's the most advanced computer model of the birth of our universe, modeling a cube of 350 million light years across.

QxeevqNAVPA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxeevqNAVPA,The future of job market with AI #AIWithAish,"Let's not sugarcoat it. The job market is changing fast. And if you're in tech, you have probably already felt it. AI is no more coming for your job. It's already here and reshaping everything. Let's talk facts. In 2025, the US job market looked steady where the unemployment rate was around 4 to 4.5%. But underneath the calm surface, the tech industry is being restructured. roles like data analyst, business analyst, data engineers, software engineers, data scientists or ML engineers are all being affected in some way or the other. Some of the roles are disappearing versus the others are exploding in demand. To be honest, AI has become a double-edged sword. On one side, it's helping teams move faster and get more work done. But on the other hand, it's reducing the need for big engineering teams. It's like sitting on a tree branch feeling productive but also sawing that very branch behind you with AI tools in your hand. Software engineering roles are down by over 35% since prepandemic highs but AI and ML specific roles they have surged up by 70%. So here's the reality. Software engineering roles are far from being dead but the bar is higher. Front-end roles are cooling down a little bit and full stack and backend engineers who build scalable crossf functional systems are still very high in demand and with market uncertainty more companies are going for contractors instead of full-time hires. Machine learning engineers and data scientists are seeing a strong demand today. One in four data science job listings emphasize AI on automation skills. So if you can build, deploy, and optimize AI models and explain them, you're in a strong position. But let's be clear, traditional machine learning is not dead for beginners. It's actually the best place to start. Understanding the fundamentals of supervised machine learning, regression, classification, they are still the building blocks of applied AI. AI tools of course are changing the game, but they are taking care of the repetitive work. So you can focus on solving real world problems. But that means expectations are higher. Technical interview difficulty is up by 12% year-over-year. Teams are smaller, but they are sharper. Employers want impact and not just headcount. So, the million-dollar question, how do you stay competitive in this market? So, here are my five tips for you. One, master the fundamentals. Make sure you have good skills in Python, SQL, and machine learning basics and get these right first. Second, specialize wisely. Pick a lane. Be it natural language processing, generative AI, computer vision, don't try to do all at once. Third, most importantly, don't chase every single buzzword. Instead of jumping between 10 different courses, set a clear learning goal for yourself. Fourth, focus on projects, not just theory. Build stuff. Create a list of portfolio projects for yourself. It doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be practical and show your skill set. And fifth, understand how things get deployed. MLOps, LLM ops, APIs, cloud integrations. This is where your models come to life. And the bonus tip I would give you is sharpen your soft skills. Communication, collaboration, problem solving are your edge in the AI saturated world. So what does the future look like? We have all heard this. Yes, some jobs will disappear, but many will evolve and many will be created. You need to understand that the future belongs to people who can think with AI, build with AI, and adapt alongside with AI. Understand that it is a tool you need to master.

We'll only issue H-1Bs to those who are working in jobs that are at the very top of the pay scale."" >> Oh, they're like eliminating lottery altogether. >> The only ones who would get the H-1B uh would be ones who actually are paid the top 90th percentile or whatever it is the level four wage for that job. Let's say I'm a product manager and level four for me is in my account is $150,000. So if I have $150,000 I'll just get a H1B basically. >> Basically yeah >> I don't have to go through lottery. >> It's going to completely decimate job prospects of all students who are coming in at entry level. >> New H1B lottery is here Samir.

So, in Trump v1, right, they tried to make the H-1B lottery like dependent like they would keep the lottery but make the selections dependent on the jobs that paid the most. >> Okay. Uh the reason uh that it didn't work is they were sued because they were trying to make a rule without making a rule, >> right? Uh and the court said you can't do that. You have to make a new rule if you want that to be the rule. You can't just change the way you administer. >> Okay? Um so they went back waited for four or five years or whatever it was and here we are. Uh they have uh and they have power over the Congress now. They have power over the courts. uh and they're making this rule um to change the way H-1Bs are issued. >> Okay. Um there's I'd say policy-wise it seems to be they have like a huge problem uh with this idea of kind of lower what they call lower wage H-1Bs. this idea of and you know I hate to say it but you know consultants and um you know IT consultants doing the work what US workers used to do at lower salaries. It's a very controversial aspect of the H-1B program and it constitutes a small percentage of all those in the H-1B, but the general public thinks that all H1Bs are alike. >> Okay. Um, and I know some of your audience are consultants and and work in consultancies, but this is this is the reality of it, right? Um, this is one way that they're trying to fight that problem. >> Yeah. >> Okay. >> Um, and so what are they trying to do? Like they're trying to basically say, ""Okay, forget the lottery. um will only issue H-1Bs to those who are working in jobs that are at the very top of the pay scale for that job in that location. >> Oh, they're like eliminating lottery altogether. >> That's right. That's right. Yeah. >> Okay. But still cap cap is still there. >> Uh still a cap. uh but just a limiting lottery and just kind of creating a process uh by which the only ones who would get the H-1B uh would be ones who actually are paid um the the top 90th percentile or whatever it is the level four wage for that job >> level four. >> Yes. Yes. >> So you tell me if that's a good thing because number one um it's going to completely decimate job prospects of all students who are coming into entry level. Okay. Uh and one might say a lay person might say, ""Well, tough. I mean, we're now we're preserving jobs for US students."" But the problem is for in many cases, in most cases, there's a reason why companies are hiring students, you know, out of international students out of grad school or even bachelor's degree programs, they can't find anybody to do these jobs. There aren't American students doing this stuff, right? Um secondly, a lot of our innovation as a country has come from the presence of obviously international talent. So this is another way to really kind of kind of kneecap the whole student visa program, right? And cut the numbers of international students to a very low figure because there's not going to be jobs waiting for them after they graduate because they're not be able to get an H-1B because like they're not going to be paid enough, right? They're not going to get the H-1Bs. >> Uh this also is going to affect startups, >> right? startups. I mean, they may they may not pay like their top engineers top salaries, but they make it up in equity or promised equity, right? >> Having the promise of equity plus a kind of low low kind of great salary is how startups do business, >> right? and the employee who may have a lot of experience takes that risk, takes that bet, you know, uh hoping for the upside of working with um a company at the very, you know, beginnings, you know, of its of its um tenure. So, um startups are going to have a really hard time because they can't afford to pay these salaries like they have to repurpose all their money towards, >> you know, development, research, or whatever it is, operating their company. Yeah. Right. and and they only have a limited runway to to spend the money they get. Um it's all going to get eaten up in these high salaries. And so um I mean that could have what what kind of trickle down effect is that going to have on the venture capital community now? >> Are they going to have to invest more money? Are they going to pull back on investment? So it's going to restrict innovation, right? This is something that's very shortsighted and it doesn't make any sense. in like >> so is it how are they going to like know what's uh so they they're saying level four so there is a range for each county basically so if I get level four maybe let's say I'm a product manager and the level four for me is in my county is $150,000 so if I have $150,000 I'll just get a H-1B basically >> basically yeah >> I don't have to go through lottery >> yeah I mean The process is not really fine-tuned yet. This is just kind of a general >> Yeah. proposal that they're >> Okay. Um >> Yeah. So, and we don't have a lot of details into the mechanics of how this is going to work yet, >> but this is a general kind of gist of what they >> And where is it where is this sitting right now in in terms of like is it moving forward? Like have you heard from your colleagues like >> No. uh it's been introduced uh obviously it must have some traction uh uh for it to have been introduced in the first place. I don't think they'd introduce it and make it public if they didn't think that they had some you know likelihood of success >> or at least some traction right um within Congress. So um so yeah uh right now it's just sitting kind of in this they've notified they're kind of like this is what we want to do or getting comments we're we're trying to figure it out. So yeah, so it's in that process and we haven't heard much. >> And then what happens like what does need to take place for this to actually become a law or not become a law? >> So basically it has to be um implemented by um legislative and executive bodies and so they they have to get um the feedback from the public. Um they have to uh create a final law. They have to go through the office of management and budgets and they have to go through the formal rule making process which could take a long time. It could take six months. It could take a year, a year and a half. It really just depends on how extensive it is. >> So, >> okay. Well, hopefully um there's some lobbying happening for this. Who knows? >> Yeah. On this and you know um we did another video on the H1Bs and NTAs and it's just like where is a technology community? like where are the CEOs? Like where are the companies that are going to stand to really get hit hard by this? I expect to hear from them fairly soon. Like at some point they're going to have to sit up and take notice and push back really hard on some of the changes that are happening here because these changes are not necessarily being proposed by economic experts, right? These are changes being proposed by restrictionists, people who don't like immigration >> and have social their own social exclusionary reasons for submitting these rules, right? Um these these are going to hurt it's going to hurt our economy, right? at some point I'm hoping somebody stands up and says. >> Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh thank you Samir for like kind of talking about this and again I know if anybody's going through H1 B1 EB1s I'll put the link uh in the description if people want to consult and they are like you know going through rough time in the immigration they want to kind of talk they can talk to you or your team. >> Yeah. >> Again thank you Samir. uh we'll talk soon or we also do every week uh Wednesday 1:00 p.m. uh California time live session. So if you have any other question on this topic, please come join us as well. But all right, thank you Samir. Hey by the way, if you ever need immigration help whether it is your consultation for specific situation or filing an H-1B visa because your company doesn't know how to do it or you are filing for your own company 01 or EB1A. Samir and his team is amazing. I know this because some of our subscribers have already reached out to them, gotten help from them. So I know they have given good feedback to me. So I know Samir and his team will help you as well. Link will be in the description. He's super kind as well that he wants to provide discount.

J5Ud_RdDtMw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Ud_RdDtMw,Brainrot is Ruining You | Documentary Film,"Lately, I've been noticing things, tiny little details everywhere I go, and they all create this sense of uneasiness in me. Cap drivers are speeding through reels while on the highway. Every mother or housewife I've recently met is deep into level 6,000 of Candy Crush. Tasty. Our bathroom breaks have gotten so much longer and dinner dates have started to feel quite quiet. Clearly, there's something a miss. An invisible virus of sorts is spreading. We're changing little by little. [Music] Something is rotting. ing our attention [Music] and I needed to know what is causing it. [Music] [Music] This is Coco Melon, every infant's favorite show. It has 193 million subscribers on YouTube and over 200 billion views. [Music] Co melon. Co melon. [Music] What you're seeing here is how children react to the Coco Melon soundtrack. They're put into an almost translike state. And this happens by design. But their success is backed by a sinister little experiment. See, what they would do is trap a child in front of two screens. On one, Coco Melon would be playing and on the other, visuals of regular everyday activity that a child couldn't care less about. They'd then note down every point where the child was losing interest in their program, and they'd later fill those points with oversaturated colors or sudden movements that triggered a response in the infant. That way, the child would have to keep watching whether they wanted to or not. And if you really think about it, this is very hard to differentiate from an actual drug addiction. [Music] Clearly, the situation is terrifying for children. But what about you? Okay, imagine you're just back home from work after a long day. You take out your phone to feel a tiny little upper. You wonder if there's been any notifications in the last few hours and log onto your favorite social media app. Except it takes a split second before your notifications are revealed. This isn't because of your slow internet speed or some glitch. It's a calculated move by tech giants who understand that by creating anticipation, they'll be able to trigger more dopamine in your brain. Hence, ensuring that you are more addicted to the process of checking notifications than the notifications themselves. This is one of countless tricks used by tech giants. The key word here is addiction and it's happening right under our noses. I mean, it's exactly the kind of thing that a that a hacker like myself would come up with because you're exploiting a vulnerability in in human psychology. the inventors, creators, it's all of these people um understood this consciously and we did it anyway. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that 64 million people worldwide suffer from drug addiction. Meanwhile, the number of people who suffer from social media addiction is estimated to be around 210 million. The drug cartle business has had centuries to amass such a huge market share. But the dopamine cartle is just an emerging startup in comparison and it's already got three times the market share. See, what keeps me up at night isn't my own dopamine dependencies. It's when I think about the kind of content today's generations are exposed to and what effects it could be having on their brains. I mean what the is this? This virus cannot spread further and yeah it is a virus because it has infiltrated our culture in the blink of an eye and before it fully corrupts the last few brain cells we have left, we have to understand its symptoms. how it affects your ability to focus, your ability to remember things, and even your ability to think critically. Hopefully, we can still fight it. So, let's break it down. This is the dorso lateral preffrontal cortex. That's the part of your brain that's responsible for your ability to focus and pay attention. And that's our first pit stop. Let me ask you this. Have you noticed yourself or people around you losing their train of thought more often lately? Or maybe you find yourself often saying the phrase, ""Wait, what were we talking about? Do you want to know why that is? On the left is a kid from your parents' generation. She wants attention, but her mom is busy doing 200 things simultaneously like moms usually do. She doesn't give up and does what she knows best, throwing a tantrum. Eventually, this devious little child manages to manipulate her mom into giving her the attention she needs. On the right, we have the modern-day kid. His parents handed him a tablet and access to dopamine-driven content for children found on the internet. a perfect recipe to avoid his tantrums. This kid doesn't know it yet, but not getting his parents' attention is now causing him to lose his ability to pay attention when needed. Why? Because his prefrontal cortex is being fed so much dopamine so fast and so often. For your brain to normalize these levels of dopamine spikes would result in your baseline being raised, which means that anything lesser would make you go, ""Nope, let's move on to something else."" In fact, you might already be experiencing some of these symptoms like your frustration when the Wi-Fi speed is slow or your need to watch YouTube videos at 1.2x speeds or why children are facing a social media crisis so prematurely. Research suggests that our attention spans have reduced from 2.5 minutes in 2003 to under 47 seconds in recent years. So I guess what I'm trying to say is [Music] Sorry, what was I talking about? You uh you were talking about attention spans, right? My bad. Sorry, I got distracted by you. We'd like to thank our partner for this video, Udu.

So what are you waiting for? Sign up for UDO community days from the link in description. This is the hippoc campus where memories of past events are stored. And this is the amygdala where all your emotional memories are stored and they function in fascinating ways. I want you to try an experiment. Try to remember a memory of yours. Something you're quite fond of. Perhaps it's a birthday party from a few years ago. Yours back when you still had short hair. Where all your loved ones were there. Even your partner at the time was there. No, not her. The one with the straight hair. She'd come all the way from Delhi for your birthday. And she brought your favorite cake. What was it? Diramisu. No, wait. You hate tiramisu. Was it pineapple? Oh, no. Wait. It was black forest kick. The candles were lit. The laughs were plenty. And it was just the best time ever. Except there's something weird and fascinating about this memory. You're seeing it in third person view. At least seven out of 10 of you are. But when you lift out the memory, you saw it all from a different perspective. No. Happy birthday to you. From your own eyes. It is widely accepted among neuroscientists that most people don't really recall a memory as much as they recreate it. You're not pulling it out of a saved file and revisiting the same data each time. Rather, you're remembering the last time you remember this memory. This process is called reconsolidation. But what's more, the emotion you're feeling while recalling a memory often alters the details of the memory itself. This is what allows us to erase all the anxieties and heartbreaks of college and eventually look back at it with rose tinted glasses. What this seems to imply is that your memory is a very unreliable and delicate system and yet it's what gives us our personality. And this incredible but fragile faculty is under attack. It's going through drastic changes because of a process called cognitive processes. That's when you externalize or delegate tasks like problem solving, decision making and um memory recollection to devices like calculators, chat, GPT, AI and even teleprompterss. Is that it? This is encapsulated perfectly by something called the Google effect. It refers to the idea that our brains are less likely to remember information if it knows that we can easily find it online. Just this week, an MIT study found that students relying on Chad GPT to write essays had the flattest brain activity patterns and could barely quote their own work minutes later. Evidence of what the researchers called cognitive debt. For today's kids, this is especially concerning since they're largely given up on habits like reading and memorizing. They won't be exercising their memory at all. A lot of these kids don't know how to read because they have had things read to them or they can click a button and have something read out loud to them. And looking at the state of things, I think it's time we put active effort towards exercising our cognitive abilities. You know, just on the off chance the apocalypse arrives, destroys civilization, kills Wikipedia, and sends us back to the stone ages. What really separates the intelligence of humans and that of other species is, you guessed it, language. Atlantico vocabulary is what helped us communicate the most complex of ideas to each other. You'd be surprised by how ingrained language is to our personalities, our culture, and the very fabric of our being. Let me show you. All right. All right. All right, everybody. Let's calm down because we are moving on to our next category, which is the German language. Let's look up at computer G. So the German word for hand is well hand but the German word for shoe is sure. So your question is what is the German word for glove? Option A hand. [Music] Option A. That is correct. [Music] All right, let's settle down because the next one is going to be even harder. The German word for cool is cool. The German word for cupboard is shrink. So your question is what is the German word for refrigerator? Option A cool shrink. Option B, option A. Option C, option B. Option C. Ah, you've chosen option C, which is actually option B. And that's option A, which is cool shrank. And that's correct. Let's once again take a look at computer G. The German language is famous for their compound words which combine two smaller words into new complex terms. It's all very straightforward and logical, isn't it? There's a study called the sapper warf hypothesis that suggests that language influences but not determines thought. Going by that, it seems to suggest that the Germans approach to their language construction may have had a role to play in their cultures inclination towards logic and precision. But let's look at another language to further explore the hypothesis. Okay, now listen carefully because this is the big one. Let's go. What is the direct English translation for the Spanish term? And this time you get no options at all. I think it's I love you. That's actually incorrect. That was actually a trick question. There is no direct translation for tiamo in English. That's right. The closest translation for I love you in Spanish is actually historically was always meant to be used as a far more intense declaration of love. Whereas if you look at English, we only have I love you. And if you wanted to convey something deeper, we generally just add adjectives and metaphors to it. Linguists call this a lexicalization difference. Spanish builds extra rungs into the love ladder so speakers hear and feel finer shades of affection from childhood. Maybe that also explains why they are such an emotionally resonant culture. If you want to learn how to make videos like the one you're watching right now, let me give you a glimpse of what it takes. [Music] [Music] Are we good to go? Yeah. Okay. Okay. [Music] Are we good to go? As you saw, it takes an army of people to create and deliver a well-produced video to you guys. And people who can do this are in high demand. With the right training, you can turn video making that's from the concept to the final cut into a high income skill with our video mastery program in less than 3 months. Most of the folks you see here are from our video editing school. So if you're a student, a job seeker, a content creator, or just somebody who wants to get into the field of video making and video editing, our program is the right place for you to start. It will take you from absolute basics and core video editing skills, storytelling, production, motion design, and genai to a hireable editor or video producer. We have trained 3,500 students, many of whom are working with some of the top creators and companies. So if you're somebody who wants to learn the skill of video editing, producing videos or are just curious about our program, sign up for the free master class that we are hosting. Link is in the description below. See, language shapes the very essence of your being in complex ways. So the creation of language requires utmost thought and care. Don't you think? Unfortunately, kids today are forming a whole new dictionary for themselves. I say that this goofy air government have been capping. Now I know it's giving to Lulu for this boo. Let's walk in negative huru. We've done a whole video on brain rod before but since then this problem has quintupled. Sure this new gen language is a fun and creative way to express abstractions but it's a language that is devoid of careful thought and structure that's essential for communication. Take the feeling of happiness for example. The words here are each meant to depict a very specific degree of happiness. It allows us to gauge a person's feeling based on context. But when it comes to Jendi slang, these words and many more like it that the internet keeps churning out every other week are monotonous and they are replacing and articulate and thoughtful vocabulary that we have built over a millennia. Language evolves over time, yes, but there's a growing concern amongst linguists and cognitive scientists that this new shift may be eroding a child's ability to communicate complex ideas. We may not be at much risk as we are part of the transition period, but for kids tomorrow, the dependence on quick and easy forms of speech could weaken their ability to structure sentences and think critically. I recently read that the average Indian spends 5 hours a day on their phone. That's six whole days a month, two and a half months a year, and around 15 years in your lifetime that you may end up doom scrolling. Another study claimed that the average person finger climbs the equivalent of Mount Everest every 20 days of scrolling. I'm not sure how to wrap my head around that. You know, when your brain receives gratification at a constant rate, it leads to something called anhidonia, the complete absence of enjoyment in your pursuits of happiness. These are statistics that indicate our predicament. However, the newest generations will be born into a world where these statistics aren't shocking. They will be the baseline, the new normal. The consequences are serious. Children with more than 60 minutes of daily screen time show significantly higher signs of ADHD. Even more alarming, early screen exposure disrupts emotional development, dulling their ability to read faces, build empathy, and navigate the social world. To make matters worse, there's a notable lack of regulation concerning the design and dissemination of children's digital content, allowing companies to prioritize engagement metrics over the well-being of the children. So, what do we do about this? If you're watching this video, you are probably dealing with the inability to feel as deeply as you used to. And if you've reached all the way to the end, then you've already taken a huge first step in the road to recovery. See, I don't have all the answers, but I can share what's been working for me, and maybe it'll work for you, too. To start off, switch your phone's display into grayscale by accessing your developer settings to avoid all those stimulating and triggering colors. You can even add extensions that actively block out brain rod content. Make sure you track your screen time religiously and even set app limits. These act as daily reminders that you are crossing the line. Protect your sleep, which is where your brain resets itself. This basically prevents the blue light from suppressing your melatonin. Next is dopamine rebalancing. This one's tough, but it works. Set aside 30 minutes where you do absolutely nothing stimulating. No phone, no TV, no podcast, no music. And lastly, every night, recount your day and write down one thing you're grateful for. It's basically training your brain on a daily basis to notice the silver lining and naturally rebalance your brain chemistry. Look, I know it's not going to be easy to do all this at first, but keep at it. Every day it gets easier, but you got to do it every day. That's the hard part.

not in some dramatic way but very subtly almost imperceptibly so 3 weeks ago I walked into a store I've been going to for years but this time something was different the checkout Lanes totally empty no cashes waiting for you anymore all there was there was literally just one tire looking employee monitoring all these new self checkout machines that have been put there in place of the usual old people honestly it felt little bit unsettling and it got me thinking that these aren't just jobs disappearing we're watching something much bigger unfold you know most people think that we are living through another technological Revolution like the steam engine or the internet we're not we're living through the end of the entire concept of jobs as we know them this put forth a lot of questions in my head what's the actual future of work going to be like how will the meaning and value of jobs change what skills will actually matter in this new world and I feel like if you are somebody who's clicked on this video you're also someone who's looking to find better answers you also know that this change is coming and understanding it might be the most important thing we can do right now so that's what I hope to do in the next 15 minutes show you where it all began where it's headed and how you can be ready for it to understand where we headed let's take a step back way [Music] back meet Isa she's a hunter gatherer living 50,000 years ago her working in a 9 to5 job it's simply life itself every day is a dance between survival and Community there's a separation between work and living success isn't measured in promotions or paychecks but in well-being of the tribe the fullness of their bellies and the stories that they passed down then slowly things started changing again so about 12,000 years ago came The Agrarian age and we started planting seeds farming changed everything we settled down built Villages property became a concept work became tied to the land to the seasons families working together during Harvest had anxiety during draws together the Rhythm of Life back then was dictated by the Earth yet amongst all of this community remained at the heart of it now while I was reading this history I learned something that might actually surprise you so in medieval times peasants worked very very hard okay but they also had an estimated 150 days off per year for Sundays and religious holidays so if you look at the research by this Boston College Economist Juliet Shore she says that because agricultural labor was very season dependent the average peasant had anywhere from 8 weeks to half the year off so Hunter gather societies worked around th000 hours per year the average medieval peasant worked around 1,620 hours per year and now the modern American Worker Works around 1,760 hours per year I'm sure the average Indian Worker Works a lot more now let's move a little bit forward in history I want to take you to the 19th century me Thomas a weaver every morning he sits at his wooden Loom carefully weaving threads into fabric it's the same work his father did and his grandfather before that the rhythm of the Loom is as familiar to him as his own heartbeat but Thomas's world is about to change forever a new invention arrives the power loom a machine that can do the work of 40 viewers times are changing work moves from homes to factories labor becomes specialized repetitive in fact Frederick winow Taylor introduces tailism which is basically the idea of Scientific Management that's breaking task into repetitive motions to maximize efficiency now as time progresses we reach 1926 in 1926 Henry Ford implements the 5 day 40-hour work week for his Factory workers this was the easiest way for him to control workers and standardize production this is the era when time becomes commodity and time is money as a concept takes root the clock now dictates the average person's life people adapt because they must you know this idea that we humans would go somewhere specific for a set number of FS to do a specialized task in exchange for money the way we have structured our entire society around jobs that's actually incredibly new like really new we're literally talking just 200 years of human history and I shared this history because it reveals something crucial for all of you to understand what we think of as normal now the 95 work day the idea of a career these are actually incredibly recent inventions and just as societies adapted then were again adapting now but right now there's one big difference if you look at the shifts they used to take generations to unfold but today change is happening at a place Humanity has never experienced before literally right now algorithms are learning at an exponential rate robots are not just assembling cars they're making decisions creating art and think about this the smartphone that you're watching this video on right now has more computing power than NASA had during the Apollo missions you know in the past mastering a skill me security for Life blacksmith tailor Learners they passed down their knowledge through generations but today the programming language you literally learn like 5 years ago might already be outdated the software you use today could be obsolute tomorrow it literally feels like running on a treadmill that's constantly speeding up and if you don't keep Pace you risk falling off but unlike a treadmill there's no emergency stop button in real life this acceleration honestly isn't just about technology it's about us our ability to adapt to learn to reinvent ourselves continuously as the world changes and before we get to what the future is going to be like how to be prepared for it I just want to acknowledge something real here because it's personal and I feel like it's something I feel change is honestly very very scary psychologists actually have a name for it they call it transition anxiety now if you look at the human brain it is always craved stability predictability it's literally a survival mechanism for us so when we are faced with uncertainty we often cling to The Familiar it's also why some people resisted the internet and why others thought that smartphones were a fat I remember thinking when I was very very young that why would I need a phone that ises more than just make calls this resistance is very natural and most of us don't want to admit it only but it can also be detrimental it's called the ostrich effect that's ignoring the danger in hopes that it'll go away but ignoring change doesn't stop it from happening it only leaves us unprepared you know my work my job what I do has always been more than just a paycheck that's how my parents raised me where work literally became my identity my purpose what I derive all the validation from what I kind of even live for to an extent so there's basically this unspoken social contract where we contribute our skills and labor and in return we gain not just the paycheck not just the income but dignity social status and a place in society through the work we do but in the future as the roles of jobs and work evolves this contact also might start fraying so that's what CAU me thinking what is the new social contract with work going to be like will it be about creating a world where work enhances life rather than detracts from it or it loses all meaning I learn two interesting things that I'd like to share with [Music] you so I found this great report by the international monetary fund and it gave me some anchors around skills and jobs of the future so the report reveals that nearly 40% of jobs globally are exposed to AI in advanced economies that number jumps to 60% due to prevalence of cognitive task oriented jobs but in emerging market economies and low-income countries like India it's about 26% so the categorized jobs based on two factors that's exposure to Ai and complimentarity with AI let me explain what this means using a real example so let's take a judge now because of advances in Tex analysis judges are highly exposed to ai ai can analyze Iz cases precedence and legal documents faster than any human can but here's the key Insight okay Society is currently unlikely to delegate judicial rulings to unsupervise AI so job like this has high complimentarity with AI That's that AI will enhance the judge's capabilities rather than replace him now let's compare this to a clerical worker processing insurance claims now they're also highly exposed to AI but have low complimentarity their task can be automated without much human oversight so for jobs which fit in this bucket that is they'll be enhanced by AI there's another very interesting Insight meet am she's a lawyer living in Bangalore a few months ago her firm started using AI to review contracts so task that used to take her team 5 hours now literally takes 3 to 5 minutes but here's what's interesting they still build their clients the exact same amount and this is what I found very fascinating what's happening right now is we're witnessing something unprecedented that's the decoupling of time from value work is not going to be related to the number of hours you put in in a lot of the digital jobs the only thing that will matter now is the output honestly even at our workplace for a lot of roles we stop tracking the hours people dedicated to a task it's all about the output sometimes it can take 40 hours sometimes with the help of AI it can literally take less than two if you look at the larger picture yes it's still a very small segment of the society is the early adop adopters leveraging the new tools but the upside of being an early adopter to a new technology is also extremely high see I'm not sing you a dream of not working or some quick become rich scheme but what I'm saying is the way you do your job now can significantly improve and people who benefit from it can benefit greatly you know in my own company I see a lot of young people in their first job facing this massive shift the environment around them isn't just competitive it's literally changing daily and well some are still stuck in this Doomer mindset that AI will take their jobs others are learning to use it as a leverage so I want to help you guys take advantage of the shift so instead of seeing AI as a threat you can use it to become more valuable both for yourself and any company you work for that's why I'm excited to tell you about the IBM skills build platform and there explore text to speech using IBM Watson X course this is not just another technical course it's a perfect example of the kind of hybrid skill that will matter in the future future understanding both AI capabilities and human needs think about it as more content moves online the ability to convert text to Natural sounding speech becomes increasingly valuable you could build tools that help students learn better through listening or busy professionals who want to consume content while multitasking or people with visual impairments or reading difficulties some examples could be voice enabled e-commerce platforms that read product descriptions to customers or educational platforms that convert textbooks to audiobooks or interactive voice response systems for customer service this course teaches you everything from basics of text analysis to creating your own text to speech system using IBM Watson X also most importantly it's absolutely free I am putting the link in description below if you're interested please do check it [Music] out now again back to the very pressing question what more can we do how do we prepare better for this time you know history actually gives us a pretty good blueprint think about it imagine being one of the first people to use Google or Gmail or the iPhone these people saw something new something different and instead of dismissing it they leaned in they had extraordinary leverage because they were early we are in that exact moment right now with AI and I want to share four specific things that you can do to be on the right side of this change firstly like I said people who got into computers in the'80s the internet in the '90s and smartphones in the 2000s they didn't wait for the technology to be perfect they jumped in early and learned as it evolved that's going to be your opportunity right now if youve ever thought about starting something a project a business an initiative now is the time the tool are accessible the opportunity vast and history shows us that many of the best companies were born during times of significant technological shift don't let skepticism or the voices saying it's overhyped de for you remember people once thought that internet also was a fat so get in early secondly and this is very very crucial look at where you work or want to work are they embracing these new tools or are they just hoping that AI will just go away I remember people saying that Blackberry will never lose to iPhone or why would anybody need more than an email mail were on the wrong side of History you ideally want to be in an environment in a workplace that's not just using AI but where you're surrounded by people who are great at using it think about it do you want to work at a company that's leading the change or the one that's resisting it so choose your environment and work place very very carefully please I recently did this session for creators with a YouTube India team and there were a lot of smart creators in the room but so many of them hadn't tried out the tools because they felt like it's too complex or not for them you know I feel like this word artificial intelligence it feels very heavy for a lot of people for a lot of average folks so they feel like it's only for the tech nerds to use but it's not it's for all of us every new technology has a learning curve I remember teaching my dad how to use Google it wasn't very intuitive for him at first using AI tools is the same way you have to jump in and start experimenting so sign up for these tools pay for them if you need to it's an investment in your future try them out in your work your projects your learning don't just read about AI you need to experience it and a lot of them require no technical knowledge and are so so easy to use lastly and this is perhaps the most important Point don't fall into the ostrich effect don't bury your head in the sand just hoping that it'll all go away you have just spent 15 minutes watching this video now you know something that many others don't but knowledge without action is worthless you actually have to do something with this information so here's a little challenge for you this week sign up for any AI tool one AI tool whichever you want and try it out so many of them are free so all you have to do is literally put in your email ID and trust me I gain nothing from giving you this advice but for folks who are here who are watching this I know you understand English I know you have a smartphone so you have literally no excuse I want every single one of you watching this to grab these opportunities to build some leverage with AI otherwise I feel like there's no point of watching our videos people who are going to be early adopters will win literally all the research all the reports everybody says this and I want these winners to be you lastly understand that future of work isn't something that's happening to us it's something we also get to shape and the real divide in the future won't be between humans and AI it'll be between those who Embrace this change early and those who waited too long question for you is which side of the Divide do you want to be on you know for some of you now this future of work might seem a little bit daunting but I truly believe that we are living through some of the most exciting times in human history and I want to keep trying to make you feel the same by helping you learn a little more about the world through our videos so if you found value in this video if it helps you think differently about your future consider subscribing also let me know in the comments what your take on all of this are you already using air tools what's holding you back by the way I read all your comments so I would love to hear what all of you have to say that is all for today's

NcxDPjhDlgg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcxDPjhDlgg,You Could Become a Millionaire in 3-5 Years,[Music] the temperature in the city had reached an all-time high and I didn't mean the weather I'd start getting noticed some eyes on me ain't no future without the Dome and I knew I had to take matters into my own hands if I was gonna have one it's gonna be a somebody they say money is just a game to learn a puzzle to solve I say money just comes down to who you know and what you can give them to me that's heat I can give him heat in your pocket that bulge stay out of my pocket Terry it feels like a girl another day of a brilliant mind is not measured by ordinary standards come on [Music] materials minerals colorful Stones Sage cover the homeless [Music] [Music] it's selling a thousand of something that costs a thousand dollars or ten thousand of something that costs a hundred any permutation of numbers really as long as there's six zeros at the end of it and in the digital age I genuinely believe that this Milestone is possible for many people maybe not for everyone but a good number of people if you're someone who is bold determined action oriented and you're willing to put in three to five years of effort on the right things that are valuable in today's economy I think a lot of people could get to that million dollar run rate much sooner than they think let me share with you what I've learned on my own Journey from broke teacher to running a seven-figure company five years later and the skill stack you could use to make your first million let me start with a question though if you could develop one quality within yourself that would reliably separate you from anyone in business or otherwise what skill do you think you would cultivate what quality would you cultivate within yourself to me I would argue that energy is the number one separator of people too many people are low energy they're grumpy they're just like walking around like Scrooge just annoyed at their life annoyed at their obligations maybe they been stuck in the same place for too long so now they're just jaded and they're just pissed off all the time more often than not the people I come across if you ask them hey how's it going how are you they won't be absolutely excited they won't share that they're pumped about what they're working on and what they're doing people are just sort of okay the first idea then is that you should cultivate the quality of having extremely high energy levels it is the number one thing that will separate you from the pack and I've seen it time and time again the person with good spirits the person who comes into life excited which is a choice the choice to be enthusiastic about your work and your life and your mission it is magnetic that person will literally start attracting great opportunities to them this is genuinely the most important part of the globe both monetarily and otherwise energy is your first wealth and to a good degree it is a choice I used to be a lot grumpier than I am now to be honest I was just like drinking too much and so it made it very difficult for me to be in good spirits and I would take so much in my life for granted the fact that my food tastes really good that the weather in Minnesota is good five months out of the year I mean it's only five months but at least it's not like the 30 long nights of Alaska I was always kind of low-key annoyed and upset and everything felt like a burden and today even if I get something like a bad night of sleep or something in my life isn't optimal I tend to be in good spirits and it has played no small part in my cascading success with money in the last year in fact this idea is so important that I want to share with you five ideas that could be helpful in this regard the first be a robot who does it's a term I made up robot mode but I think you should fill up your calendar with stuff that you should be doing stuff that is good for you to be doing to make progress with your career but also your relationships hanging out with friends Hobbies whatnot fill up your calendar with useful stuff and then just do it it sounds really obvious but do what your calendar says and do it as if you're a robot because if you don't if you actually listen to your mind about how you should proceed with any given task I don't know why it is but pretty much before 90 of things demands as us is not a good idea for this right now it's not a good time to do this you put it on your calendar like a previous version of you sought to do this thing but as soon as any Endeavor is before you for some reason the Mind often is like oh okay we have to do this I've found that it's often useful to tell myself I am an emotionless robot I live in a nihilistic world that has no meaning but it doesn't matter because I have no feelings and I should just go about my robot ways I should do what my programming tells me to do and then as soon as I start doing the the things that I said on my calendar I feel happy I feel good and it gives me energy the fallacy is that we think we need energy to do stuff but so often when you do stuff it gives you energy the perfect example of this for me is running I enjoy running I really believe in it actually but sometimes before I go running I feel tired my mind tells me I'm underrecovered [ __ ] Minnesota this place is way too cold I don't want to go outside today and try to get this running it makes no sense for me to do this you know what it has an antagonistic effect with muscle building so if I run I'm gonna be small and ugly and no woman will ever love me in the long run and then somehow I lace up even if it's cold and dark and I start the run and as soon as I start the run I feel great I feel absolutely fantastic and in fact in March of this year I ran something like 150 miles all outside many of those days it was like 10 to 30 degree weather or it was snowing very violently and once I started running it didn't feel cold I felt fantastic so when you start doing things things you feel great which brings me to the second sub principle which is in fact running I think a lot more people should be running there's a lot of gym Bros out there who think you know cardio kills their gains and it is true to like a small degree yes technically it has an antagonistic effect to lifting but it's not going to hurt your gains that much and I found the compounding benefits of being outside in the sun running getting sunlight sleeping better at night it actually is better for your gains overall and especially running gives you energy I don't know what it is but a sweet spot number of miles like between three and seven or maybe up to eight miles you actually still can feel fresh afterwards if you build up slowly and you just are sharper you have a clear brain you become more energized and refreshed it even makes you cuter like your skin starts to look better I think maybe there's just toxins leaving your body maybe you're just oxygenating yourself up more nothing has actually had a more profound effect on my mental health and overall well-being and energy than running this is the hack lifting weights while it is awesome does not give you energy or sharper brain in fact it does the opposite if you do like a really hard day of lifting if you do a brutal leg day with my trainer you will not produce any thoughts for the next several days you will live your life in a haze and really what it is going to feel like is you woke up from a coma two days later but running doesn't do that running makes you feel happy it makes you feel fresh not everyone is inherently a runner but you know what I didn't think I was either like a year ago a year and a half ago I couldn't even run a mile under like 9 minutes and 45 seconds you improve you progress in it slowly and you get better and I will say it has been one of the most energizing qualities that I've cultivated in my life the third sub principle then is don't take on unnecessary obligations this one is [ __ ] huge if you don't want to do something that isn't a responsibility that you absolutely have to do if you don't want to do something just get out of that commitment if you do stuff that you don't want to do with your life it will kill you inside it will make you hate your life it'll suck up all the energy and inspiration from your life but a lot of us I don't know why we're people Pleasers we say yes to things that we Don don't feel like doing I've been doing this all my life where I don't know a roommate of mine might invite me to some party or some gathering with a bunch of people I don't care about and I'll be like oh yeah I'll go or in the past I would be pressured to like drink in America if you don't drink that's like the one drug you can abuse where people think it's weird if you're not engaging they think you have a problem if you're not doing it so I would just drink out of peer pressure even if it was one or two beers it would kill me inside and it has been one of the tougher aspects of my self-improvement journey to tell people to [ __ ] off not quite in those words but if I don't feel like doing something if I don't have to do something and I don't want to do it I will try to get out of it or I'll just say hey I'm not free I'll say anything I might just say hey I don't want to do this I don't care about you [ __ ] off it doesn't come across quite so mean-spirited but it is such a freeing thing to either take care of your responsibilities there are of course things we have to do in life that you know it is work like there is work to be done and you got to do it you don't necessarily feel Overjoyed to do it but it's a responsibility but then it's either a responsibility or something that you are inspired to do something that is like a hell yes for you if you only have those two things in your life then your energy levels will be significantly higher and your internal sense of being about your work and about your life will be that much greater this brings me to the fourth idea which is sleep sleep is like the single most important thing ever unfortunately I put this a little lower on my sub principles list because I struggle with sleep I have poor sleep hygiene I always have I've always had a bit of insomnia it often feels like at 10 pm that's when my mind wakes up and starts to be created even starts to dream and have hope and possibility usually around 2 to 4 pm is when complete desolation exists in my mind I think there's no hope really that's when I should that's what I should be falling asleep but around 9 or 10 p.m that's when I'm like the inspiration comes back and I feel like doing things again so I don't always have the best sleep hygiene but I have improved my sleep quite a bit and that has come from cutting out alcohol to a very large degree and also filling up my calendar filling up my day with a lot of good stuff waking up early getting after it all day and then sleeping at night like making the decision to sleep at some point at night most nights I fall asleep around 11 30 and wake up at 7 now a very reasonable schedule for a guy who doesn't have great sleep hygiene but prioritize your sleep as much as possible and try to cut out those things that hurt your sleep blue light at night drinking racing thoughts try to calm yourself down and make sleep like a thing you prioritize because of course it's important and then the last thing is stay high vibration this is a choice this is actually the heart of the entire first principle because I think to a good degree having high energy is a choice just to keep your spirits High play some Hilary Duff and make out with your [ __ ] cat if you're a guy you should cultivate sexual discipline you should not ejac all the time okay if you've got this engine and you got oil in the engine I don't know how cars work but you've got this Engine with oil don't have oil spills all the time right because then you can't drive the car as well if you keep the oil of your engine inside of you instead of having oil spills all the time you'll feel angry you'll feel horny and that's a powerful combo for being productive and getting after it it's a winning combination my boy The Inspired person brings magic into a room and a state of internal inspiration can create value out of seemingly nothing I've belabored this first point but high energy is the single most important quality you need to cultivate and nurture not just for a million dollars but really to live the life that you're seeking to live it'll change your life the second principle then that I want to share with you is hack the day job through a high income skill unlike a lot of complainers in naysayers online I actually think nine to five jobs are fantastic there's no way way I would have made progress with my business or any of my goals if I didn't have a nine to five job first in fact I would argue my life fully began with a nine to five job when I first got my solid remote paying job that's when my life really began if you're starting out in life and you want to be on that three to five year trajectory to becoming a millionaire in a semi-ordinary way get a job and love it bring that same enthusiasm that I talked about in the last idea bring that to your job so many people complain about corporate politics meetings mundane tasks listen all of these things are there in a corporate position if you're working for someone else there are going to be inefficiencies or things you roll your eyes at but you can also find a job that isn't so annoying by learning a high income skill I know that good well-paying relatively headache free jobs are out there because I had one there's no way I would have made such strides on the way to becoming a millionaire without my day job the goal with the day job is to eventually I would say within three months six months or even up to a year make between 70 and 100K per year while having a relatively Chill Lifestyle where you're not super stressed unlike doctors who while in The Residency they're like overworked and extremely stressed all the time what you want is that sweet spot sort of position where you're getting enough you're not fully worried about like how you're going to pay rent or anything but your lifestyle is kind of chill if you focus on learning things that are valuable in today's economy you can absolutely do this some skills that I think are worth investing in learning really well these could be video editing CRM Technologies coding project management High ticket sales and trade skills things like becoming an electrician in a pretty short amount of time the foundational Point here is to get a base salary that pays you well but that doesn't kill you in terms of workload it'll give you a disposable income it'll take off some of your stress and it'll free up your mental faculties to search for the real opportunity which brings me to principle three learn a skill that is authentic to your life in his book how to get rich Felix Dennis calls the start of figuring out a business model the search any labels three factors involved in the search these are inclination attitude and then fate I think it's very cool actually that he starts with inclination because your inclinations do count here's the thing about value in most people in the modern world the things that you're interested in those things that you've sort of worked on or have had an affinity for and you've practiced to some degree your knowledge your interests in those things has value to our parents value existed inside of a bubble value was something they could tangibly understand like becoming a mechanical engineer or a doctor pretty much every immigrant parent just wants their kid to become a doctor it's not because being a doctor is the only way to produce value but it's because to their Simple Minds it is the most immediate way to produce value it's such a tangible return on value like someone is sick this person theoretically heals an illness that's valuable but in the modern world the conventional roots of value are not the only ones that people will pay for the ability to provide value exists across the entire range of Human Experience so maybe in your spare time you really wanted to figure out how to get hot girls there's value in teaching people how to do that or how to find the man of your dreams or maybe you cook extremely well you just naturally developed an inclination for cooking or you're a vegan and you're a bodybuilder and you've figured out your own specific meal plan for putting on size reducing the amount of processed foods you eat and feeling great Living Well maybe you were lonely in a period of your life and then you hacked how to build a Social Circle and you in fact developed your own inherent philosophy around how to make a lot of friends or how to throw dope parties or how to even get into very cool Events maybe you're really good at traveling like you're one of those people who has like the AmEx card or you know you've tried every single travel credit card and you know how the point systems works you know which hotels are the best in which city you have this whole system around how to Vacation well or dressing well you're someone who dresses extremely stylishly and people always compliment you on that there's value in being able to teach people how to be as stylish as you are but you have to kind of investigate your affinities your inclinations first and see which ones you have an aptitude in as Dennis writes and understanding and passionate Affinity with any subject in combination with effective management sales and marketing techniques could well provide a tailor-made solution to the search cherish your inclinations and affinities now the reason I mentioned the day job thing before is because usually it takes a bit of time takes a little bit of living to figure out your affinities your inclinations and then it takes Capital to like invest in them so if you got really stylish it's probably because you had the money to spend on some clothes so finding the skill that is true to your life is going to take time and so getting a solid day job and staying in it for a little bit of time is useful because it gives you time and leverage to live a life where you can do stuff and learn stuff and at this stage you don't need to make like a product or service quite yet in fact I think a lot of people they want to jump into the product or service or like entrepreneurship way too early it's like they're trying to hack their way into like business success when really it is something that progresses naturally and authentically considering where you're at in life and yeah there are YouTube videos online about starting a this over a weekend you know Drop Shipping or whatnot and like climbing up to a million dollar run rate in just a few months but I kind of have to call BS like most of those people who make such videos or preach advice about quickly making money starting a major business model starting a big company in a short amount of time it usually doesn't work out for most people it in fact is better to build it up slowly so essentially find a thing that is yours this Affinity this competitive Advantage eventually will turn into your Million Dollar business and even if you haven't productized or developed the exact whatever model of how you're going to give this value to other people you should also journal and write you should figure out like hey how has this worked out for me you know you'll probably find you naturally end up doing these things if you learn something really well and so you can essentially create this system that works for you and create your own philosophy around it and then maybe just start considering very gently how you could bring this philosophy to other people's lives to give them the same value that you are getting from your thing the next idea then is really important and that is attract dope people into your life who for absolute Killers I'm actually not sure how this happens but it happens rather organically it goes in this order become awesome yourself if you're someone who cultivates a very high energetic Magnetic Personality within yourself just through habits and through Choice the choice to be optimistic and positive and growth oriented and then you also get a high income skill which turns into a job that gives you a passive income and then you start developing an interest that interest that could be an answer to your search you naturally will attract such people into your life I couldn't attract very successful people into my life until I worked on these things myself and created that Constitution Within Myself and in fact now every single person on my team I would argue they're like the best version of their responsibilities like Thomas my editor I would say he's like one of the best editors on YouTube I feel embarrassed saying that Thomas but leave it in will you have the people need to know they would agree Axel my now main videographer is excellent at lighting composition he wasn't there inherently but he had that mindset of wanting to improve and he had that attitude everyone on the team did they had this attitude of just wanting to put out their best work not even for anyone but just rather themselves and so when you are that person it's a lot easier to recognize that in other people and then form connections with them maybe you're lifting at the gym and then you spot some Gym Bro and then you end up chatting you realize you both I don't know like riding motorcycles together you started hanging out he becomes a friend when you make this kind of connection when you have this sort of Association this is the only action step you need to do tell them what you are working on that's it say hey this is my job this is what I do but I'm what I'm really passionate is about this thing and actually I was sort of curious like could I teach this thing to other people that's it I don't know how it happens but the gaps start to get filled in in fact when I was writing the script I was considering what is that million dollar skill stack like what skills should you learn in what order but if I break down what I did with my own life I didn't learn every single skill I knew for instance that for online business copywriting is important you know making a landing page learning sales and marketing or business Ops location manager for some of the shoots that I do all of this is important but I didn't learn all of these things in order for myself what actually happened is that I learned one thing and I set a small intention and then people started coming into my life who were fantastic maybe not fantastic even from the get-go but they became fantastic the first example of this was actually Vincent five years ago I started my first corporate job at Thompson Reuters and I ran into a friend from college and high school actually we went to high school and college we were never really friends in those arrows of our life but I ran into him at this very like mundane beige corporate job I was an SEO specialist he worked in ux design and we started hanging out I told him about my interest in wanting to make an actress demo reel at the time that was my biggest goal and he didn't really know how to use a camera that well although he had done a little bit of photography for some of his friends but we started hanging out we started talking and he actually ended up shooting one of the scenes in my actors demo reel and slowly in fact we started making YouTube videos together and my thumbnails improved slightly my inherent even slightly interest in composition and color and b-roll or whatnot started on a Canon Rebel t6i with Vincent five years ago and now he's full time with me as like a business operations manager so these things escalate when you have people in your life who you bring into your circle and that's a very exciting part of this whole thing same thing happened with Manoj later on because of my association with him my understanding of online business and marketing improved also these weren't tactical conversations it wasn't networking oftentimes it was us hanging out on a Friday night and talking about our interests or inclinations or affinities and slowly like these conversations LED toward words growth and us helping each other out becoming collaborators your collaborators will become your talent who will cover your skill gaps and it is at this point in your business money Journey where Life starts to get very exciting the last idea then is slowly work your way to launching something that could have scale if you can sell something to one other person other than just your time your time can be included as a part of it but sell them something other than just your time then you have an opportunity to scale and you have an opportunity to make like the big bucks but to start out to get to that thing that scales first do the things that don't scale you build your brand one person and one interaction at a time you will naturally produce the minimal viable product or service because you have no other choice so don't worry about reading The Lean Startup or whatnot being like what's my minimal viable product it will happen naturally and then try solving the problem that you solve for yourself for just one paid client initially this could mean selling your time but later on this may translate to digital products physical products apps ebooks a coaching program or you could even Translate into other people's labor and having a more traditional business where you run a video agency or a card detailing business you don't need to throw all of your resources at solving some random problem you don't need to attack this like oh what's my million dollar company idea going to be instead arrive at it from an authentic place for you you can't jump through the stages in business later on the skills or the talent that are important to acquire for where you're at they will naturally emerge I honestly wish I didn't waste so much time in my early days reading business books because I couldn't apply any of that knowledge but eventually you know when it made sense for me to learn copywriting to make a landing page I took a copywriting course and so when you work on the next problem that makes sense the next small strategic goal you actually naturally realize oh now I need to learn this oh and now we need to hire for this thing and you slowly find yourself arriving at a business model that works and then the game of making that business grow will become one of the great joys of your life before closing out I want to take a quick pause to talk about the captain Sinbad YouTuber coaching program essentially there are are seven attributes for succeeding on YouTube there's seven different I guess principles Big Ideas that people need to work on and any one of those steps could bottleneck you those are market research essentially figuring out your content strategy your titles there's making thumbnails there's video scripting revising your script slash learning how to research and make your script stronger this happens by building in more authenticity more Authority and being more emotionally connected with your words there's rehearsing the script there's a level of like acting but not acting coming from a true place inside your video recording the a-roll recording the video or recording it in whatever format makes sense for your channel and then lastly editing editing for comprehension any one of these steps if you don't know how to do well it will bottleneck you so for instance if inside the video you are very good and you're very magnetic you're actually a personality on camera but you don't know how to script so you don't know how to present your ideas elegantly and efficiently you will bottleneck your growth or if you're actually good at scripting but you don't know how to package your video into a title or thumbnail that works for the platform you will severely bottleneck yourself so I've found as we've now worked into five cohorts of the academy and now we're adding on chord six and seven I've found that a lot of people have talent online they have talent to tell stories over video on platforms like YouTube but they don't know what their bottlenecks are and so they actually stifled themselves not for like months but rather years like three to four years someone could hold themselves back and never climb over 200 300 subscribers and then as soon as they start working on what the bottlenecks are and starting to ease those up getting from like a two out of ten level of something up to a 5 out of 10 level over five weeks or two months suddenly their video views go from like 50 views of video to 200 to 2000 to 20 000 and eventually even bigger than that and in fact because of this there's always been at least one or two people inside every single cohort of our group

debt financially successful but your efforts do compound and one thing I've realized is that in today's economy in today's Digital World things happen very dramatically and very quickly scale can happen very quickly because of the internet because of what it means to make money in the modern world and value especially value value is created for more than just these positions that our parents told us this is the right way to proceed like so much of what you bring to the table that is in fact an inner constitution of yourself has value and then you find that even when you do make the million dollars or get to that million dollar run rate it wasn't actually about the money it was about having a life that felt free having a life that had a sense of momentum because once you get to one Milestone you are going to get excited about the next and you're probably going to be like not fully satisfied you're grateful but you're not satisfied but that's okay because you've now uncovered this key to produce value at scale with something that you love and it's a delightful feeling it's like there's anxiety there's stress there's ambition there's excitement there's Joe boy it's a delightful process and I'm very grateful that I never gave up when I was 25 when I was broke and tired and for months on end when it felt like I would never be successful I'm just kind of glad that I kept going and really that's the biggest thing I want to leave for anyone watching this it feels very recent to me to feel like I was struggling with money and feeling like I could never get out of it

Y6qPdbikZcY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6qPdbikZcY,The GREATEST Nofap Benefit (I WAS WRONG!),jeffrey says he can't sleep without fapping first it's good for you fapping reduces your chance of prostate cancer and it increases your testosterone and if you watch porn it increases your one rep max in the gym but jeffrey doesn't realize that he's missing out on the greatest nofap benefit of all he doesn't realize just how much fapping and watching porn affects his self-image and because of that jeffrey never grows okay gather round boys i'm gonna be completely honest and unfiltered of my recent story of being down bad i've been on nofap for like seven years and of course i struggled at first for the first few years i was relapsing every few days i recently downloaded tinder and bumble and started using instagram more to speak to girls and it put me in this very very obsessed addictive state where i was constantly going from tinder messaging every girl to bumble messaging every girl to instagram messaging every girl to tinder messaging every other girl i started spending more than an hour per day literally just messaging girls and i was getting horny and i was like this for a solid one or two weeks i controlled that sexual urge put it into my work tried to stay productive i stayed on no fap but eventually the urge got very very strong to the point that now i was starting to spend more than two to three hours per day literally just being obsessed about girls i had the idea that maybe it would go better with these girls if i was in more of a sexual mood so i start getting an erection whilst messaging them and one thing leads to another and i stumble onto 4chan and before i know it i'm in the exact same situation and environment that i used to be in when i used to be a proper fapper i'm literally on like the porn videos of 4chan where people have like edited them together with like music videos and it's unbeaten and you're supposed to stroke it on beat i was [ __ ] down bad the one thing i'm proud of is that i didn't relapse i didn't even bust the nut or anything but this made me really realize the greatest benefit of nofap that i haven't actually spoke about on my channel before adonis adonis has been on nofap for so long that his streak is in roman numerals he knows the consequences of fapping and watching porn and adonis looks around confused at the addictions of the modern man he wonders why they don't just discipline themselves to retain their sexual urge and put it into their work but there is a small group of men that adonis notices this group of men are saying you to normal society we don't want to fap anymore we're fasting we don't want your sugar adonis smiles he looks like he's impressed for the sake of growth i like to admit when i take l's so as i said a few weeks ago i was down bad i literally watched porn for the first time in about one and a half years and i realized a simple yet astronomical benefit of being on nofap and not watching porn it stops you from feeling like a loser now it might just be me but i think you might be able to relate to this when i was actually watching like the porn videos it was like my mind was generating such negative thoughts it was constantly questioning me what are you doing you know about nofap you know about not watching porn you know how it [ __ ] up your brain you're literally watching the woman that you want get by a different guy you're acting like a cuck right now it made me feel like [ __ ] and i'm so so glad that it did when you take a huge step back from watching porn and masturbating you stop getting those negative thoughts and you start to feel like the man but think about the self-image of the average guy on the street who still faps he's automatically going to feel like a loser like a cuck like a beta male but oh shut up bro alpha males don't exist why you've watched that cringey video by buzzfeed so alpha males don't shut the [ __ ] bro dumbass a lot of people say using the term beta and i'll face cringe i don't give a [ __ ] that explains exactly what's going on here if there is one iconic act of the beta male is that he masturbates whilst watching the alpha which one do you want to be you might not be there yet but at least emulating the behavior of the alpha of like the best man the ultimate man adonis will get you closer and so i'll totally admit and say that i was wrong because for the past while i've been saying that the benefits of nofap aren't as big as most people make them out to be i still somewhat agree with that but i've realized now that i was blinded by the ignorance of having made so much progress that i stopped being able to relate to the guys who are struggling with porn and masturbation having now dipped back into that lifestyle just for like an hour or so i realized how bad it is for you the short moments of pleasure and not worth the sacrifice to your self-image and that goes with every instant gratification activity video games junk food drugs porn and masturbation just always ask yourself this one question is your future self proud of the action that you're taking today if he's not if your future self is looking back and he's cringing at your actions and he's thinking why the hell is this guy still fapping why is he still playing video games why is he coping and saying that he plays one hour a day when actually he plays more like four just do things for your future self do the hard work especially when you don't feel like

9R_BCfEipZs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R_BCfEipZs,Who did the Führer Trust? Hitler's Inner Circle,"In January 1933, Adolf Hitler becomes Chancellor of Germany. It's a shock to many in the Reich stag. But for Hitler's close supporters in the Nazi party, it's the beginning of a secret race behind the scenes. A race which determines who will be the most powerful member of Hitler's inner circle and the Nazi party itself. In these early days of the Nazi state, a select group of figures were key to Nazi leadership. The first among these was Rudolph Hess, Hitler's deputy and a fanatically loyal member of the party. Next was Herman Guring, whose charm and opportunism rewarded him with a slew of important ceremonial and practical positions. Alongside Guring stood Ysef Gobles as Reich's minister of public enlightenment and propaganda who ensured that his loyalty to the party translated into influence over the German people. Beneath these was Hinrich Himmler, the softspoken but calculating head of the SS. Finally, there was Ernst Room as head of the SA, a fanatic paramilitary organization staffed by violent enforcers known as the Brown Shirts. Room's loyalty to Hitler was unquestionable, but his ambitions clashed with the future vision of the Nazi state. His push to turn the SA into a revolutionary army of millions alienated both the military elite and members of Hitler's inner circle. By June 1934, Hitler faced a growing crisis within his regime. The SA had swelled to a force of over 4 million men, threatening both the German military and Hitler's vision for the Nazi party. Room's ambitions made him a liability. From June 30th to July 2nd, Hitler ordered a purge of the SA that was undertaken by their former subordinates in the SS. Since its founding, Guring had transferred control of the Gestapo to Himmler, who in turn appointed a trusted SS officer by the name of Reinhard Hydrich as its head. Under Guring's oversight and Himmler's purview, Room and dozens of others were executed in a single night with many targets, including Hitler's political opponents and old allies, suspected of disloyalty. The terror and bloodshed that enveloped Germany, would come to be remembered as the night of long knives.

By August 2nd, Hitler had removed all obstacles to power, becoming furer of Germany. for the inner circle. The purge was also transformative. By the mid 1930s, Hinrich Himmler had grown the SS from a small protection force into one of the most powerful institutions in Nazi Germany. Their role in the night of the long knives was rewarded with independence and expanded authority. By the eve of war, SS responsibilities ranged from party security, general policing, enforcing racial laws, and running concentration camps. While Himmler built his empire within the SS, Herman Guring was busy making new friends through patronage. Along with his existing positions, Goring was appointed planet potentiary for the 4-year plan. This authority over German economic and industrial policies gave him leverage which he enjoyed to its fullest extent enriching himself and his allies. His gregarious activities cemented power over the wider Nazi party but also created resentment among other party members who viewed this extravagance and opportunism with disdain. While others squabbled for Hitler's favor, another player remained in the background, Martin Borman, who was an indispensable aid of the Furer. His unassuming demeanor masked a calculating mind, and he used his proximity to Hitler to marginalize rivals and expand his reach. Rivalry and competition in the party leadership was ripe, but rarely led to direct confrontation. Instead, there were subtle contests of manipulation and positioning with each player attempting to prove their worth to the furer. Hitler was aware of the scheming and aimed to keep his inner circle divided, ensuring their dependence on him while maintaining his ultimate authority over the Nazi leadership. Or at least he thought so. In May of 1941, Rudolph Hess made a shocking and unauthorized flight to Britain. After many years of being sidelined in the Nazi hierarchy, he aimed to prove his worth to Germany. Believing he could broker a peace deal with the British to end the war in the West, Hess flew a Messersmid BF- 110 to Scotland where he parachuted into captivity. Upon hearing what Hess had done, Hitler was furious. He saw it as a personal and political humiliation. The Furer publicly denounced Hess as mentally unstable, stripping him of his titles and removing any mention of him from party propaganda. In his place, Martin Borman was promoted to Hess's former position, becoming head of the Furer's party chancellor. Meanwhile, Reinhardt Hydrich was cementing his position as one of the most ruthless and cunning figures in the Nazi regime. As head of the Reich main security office, Hinrich oversaw the Gestapo, the Intelligence Service, and the International Criminal Police Commission, giving him unparalleled power over Nazi security operations. His intellect and organizational skills made him a trusted executor of Hitler's most brutal policies, including the planning of the final solution. Hydrickch was also adept at consolidating his own power. He frequently undermined rivals by collecting incriminating evidence through the extensive intelligence networks under his control. His political cunning ensured that his loyalty to Hitler was beyond question, even as he subtly maneuvered against potential threats within the inner circle. By 1941, Hydrich's combination of loyalty, competence, and ruthlessness had bumped him a few rungs up the ladder of the Nazi hierarchy. Hydrickch's rising influence was also catching the attention and suspicions of Goring and Himmler. Despite their own differences, both of them recognized the threat he posed to their own positions. So, it was convenient for them that Hydrickch was attacked in Prague on May 27th, 1942 by Czech resistance operatives. Though initially surviving the ambush, Hydrickch succumbed to his injuries a week later. For Hitler, Hydrickch's death was a personal and operational loss. He viewed Hydrich as the epitome of loyalty and efficiency. A man who could execute even the most horrific policies without hesitation. In retaliation, Hitler unleashed brutal reprisals, including the destruction of the Czech villages of Leichia and Ljaki to send a message to potential resistance movements. Within the inner circle, Hydrickch's absence created a power vacuum in the Nazi security apparatus, one that his rivals were eager to fill. For Guring, the chance to fill this spot was waning by the day. Once Hitler's close confidant and face of the Nazi military industrial complex, Guring's failures in the civil sector as well as the head of the Luftbuffa had tarnished his reputation. The four-year plan he had been put in charge of had fallen apart. While his defeat during the Battle of Britain had left the Royal Air Force as a permanent threat to the Reich's security, his extravagant lifestyle and frequent absences from critical military discussions only exacerbated his decline. Hitler began to see him as unreliable and ineffective. During the later years of the war, others continued vying for their chance to reach the top. Since 1942, Albert Shar had succeeded Fritz Tat as Minister of Armaments and war production and had been working diligently on architectural and industrial programs aimed at improving the Reich. By 1943, his diligence had paid off. Unlike many in Hitler's inner circle, Shar gained the Furer's trust through competence rather than flattery or manipulation, Martin Borman remained careful in his ascent to power. As Hitler's private secretary and head of the party chancellory, he entrenched himself as the Furer's gatekeeper. By mid 1943, Borman had become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich, carefully curating the information given to the Furer and manipulating decisions in his favor. Borman's administrative mastery allowed him to outmaneuver rivals, gradually isolating Hitler from dissenting voices within the leadership. By the late stages of the war, Borman's influence was so pervasive that other members of the inner circle regarded him with both fear and contempt. As the Reich was battered by the advancing Allied forces, the Nazi inner circle continued to weather its own setbacks. On July 20th, 1944, disillusioned Vermacht officers carried out an assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler. Though they failed, the attack profoundly shook the Nazi leadership and confirmed Hitler's own growing paranoia. This led to purges within the military and heightened distrust of the furer's confidants. For the others, the assassination was an unexpected boon. The grip of the SS tightened as they were given priority in more security and military matters over the disloyal Vermach. Meanwhile, Admiral Carl Donuts, a naval commander uninvolved in the conspiracy, gained Hitler's favor as he sought loyal replacements. Donut's military acumen would ultimately lead to his appointment as Hitler's successor. In Germany's last months, Ysef Gobble's role as Minister of Propaganda became increasingly critical to maintain the regime's grip on power. Gobble's intensified efforts to rally the German people through his total war speeches and relentless propaganda campaigns which glorified Hitler's leadership and called for unwavering sacrifice. Despite the crumbling state of the Reich, Gobles portrayed every setback as a prelude to ultimate victory, creating a sense of both defiance and desperation among the populace. As the war neared its conclusion, his influence granted him the appointment of Reich Planetentiary for total war in 1944. By this point, Gobles had become one of Hitler's most trusted deputies, cementing his place as a central figure in the regime's final days. As the Third Reich collapsed in 1945, betrayal and paranoia consumed Hitler's inner circle. In a last bid for relevance, Herman Guring requested to assume leadership as Berlin fell, believing Hitler incapacitated. Martin Borman framed this as treason, leading Hitler to strip Goring of his titles and order his arrest. Albert Shar defied Hitler's orders on the Nero decree, sparing Germany's infrastructure before fleeing Berlin for the short-lived Fenceburg government. Meanwhile, Hinrich Himmler's secret peace negotiations with the Allies were soon discovered, leading to his own ejection from power. Isolated in the fearer bunker, Hitler trusted only Yseph Gobles and Borman, his paranoia driving him to condemn allies as traitors. By the time of his suicide on April 30th, 1945, the inner circle had fragmented, mirroring the regime's collapse.",HIGH,SIGNAL,ww2_history,history,1,4,4,Historical documentary on Hitler's inner circle with detailed narrative and context.,
